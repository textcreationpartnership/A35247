            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the Variety and Greatneſs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are capable of affording ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a Reader, you will have in this Piece I now preſent thee wherewith abundantly to ſatisfie thy Curioſity. You have first a perfect Account of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of Mankind concerning a Deity; their ſeveral fantaſtical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in their Devotion and Worſhip; and likewiſe a Compendium of the many Schiſms and Hereſies that have been in the Chriſtian Religion it ſelf. Then you are entertained with the Life, Death, and abominable Doctrine of that grand Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and this Account may in ſome kind be a means to hinder others from falling into the like Errors and Abominations. After this you have
<pb facs="tcp:46445:3"/>a Deſcription of the diverſe and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Rites of most Nations of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in their Cuſtoms, and Celebration of Marriages, and Solemnization of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, intermingled with ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of extraordinary Love and Affection. Then you have a relation of the ſeveral fore Bodings and Apparitions that foretold the Fall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the final Deſtruction of that famous City; with many other inſtances too long here to inſert: So that you have in this Epitome what has been the ſubjects of the greatest Pens which have filled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny large Volumes, and would require a great deal of time to read over; and I hope may be a means to induce us to bleſs and praiſe God the more, for having brought us into the light of Truth when we ſee how many millions of men have wandred in ſuch horrible Darkneſs.</p>

            <p>AMongſt the many millions of Faces which have been, and are to be ſeen in the World there are not any two of 'em that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and in all points alike: and tho there may be ſome ſimilitude in Voices, and in the Deportment and Behaviour, yet there is ſomething in every one that is peculiar, and a certain Air that ſerves to difference and diſtinguiſh one man from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſo there is no leſs variety in the Wits, Minds, and Inclinations of men. From whence proceeds, not only the alteration and variety of the Cuſtoms and Manners of Nations, and particular Perſons, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Idolatrous Worſhip, and Paganiſm, that have been in the World, and the many Sects and Schiſms that have ſtarted up in the true Religion it ſelf. Which to make appear, is the ſcope and buſineſs of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And firſt, we will begin with <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and ſhew the ſtrange Whimſies and Caprices of mankind in their Opinions of a Deity, and the Worſhip that was to be paid thereto. Thus then, the antient <hi>Babylonians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped <hi>Jupiter</hi> under the name of <hi>Belus, Bel,</hi> and <hi>Baal, Juno</hi> under the name of <hi>Aſtoroth,</hi> or <hi>Aſtorte.</hi> And their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46445:5"/>Prieſts called <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Magi</hi> were bound by their Superſtitious Diſcipline to worſhip the Sun, and ſo was the King to offer him every day a white Horſe richly furniſhed. The <hi>Fire</hi> they alſo worſhipped, and the <hi>Earth</hi> too, under certain Names: to the <hi>Earth</hi> they kept a certain Feaſt for five days in <hi>Babylon;</hi> where, during that time, the Servants were Maſters, and the Maſters Servants. They worſhipped alſo <hi>Venus;</hi> for maintaining of whoſe Service, the Women proſtituted themſelves to Strangers: theſe held a Divine Providence, but denyed a Creation, and were much addicted to Aſtrology and Divination. <hi>Ninus</hi> was the firſt Idolater; who after the Death of his Father <hi>Belus,</hi> ſet up his Image, and cauſed it to be adored with Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in the reſt of his Dominions: thus they were Men whom the <hi>Pagans</hi> affirmed to be Gods; and every one according to his Merits and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, began after his Death to be worſhipped by his Friends: thus all the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were the Images of dead men. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> God <hi>Oſyris</hi> was a Man, who, becauſe he diſtinguiſhed every Region in the Camp by their Colours, in which, Dogs, Oxen, and other Beaſts, were painted; therefore, after his Death, he was honoured under thoſe Shapes: and this begot in 'em ſuch a Veneration for thoſe Creatures, that when there was a mighty Famine in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo as that all kind of Food failed them, they betook 'emſelves to feed upon Man's Fleſh, when in the mean time they ſpared Dogs, Cats, Wolves, Hawks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they worſhipped as their Gods; and not only forbore to lay Hands upon them, but alſo fed them, and that too with Man's Fleſh. The Ancients were no leſs ridiculous in the Choice of their Gods than in their Worſhip to 'em: for, if we do but conſider <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Adulteries, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſts with his own Siſter <hi>Juno,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva;</hi> if his Sodomy with <hi>Ganymedes,</hi> his raviſhing of <hi>Europa</hi> and many others; if his Impiety againſt his Father <hi>Saturn,</hi> whom he drove out of his Kingdom,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46445:5"/>and forced to hide himſelf in <hi>Italy;</hi> if we conſider theſe things, we muſt needs ſay that he was ſo far from being a God, that he ſcarce deſerved the name of a Man, but rather of a Savage Beaſt; and indeed, not unlike in Salacity to the Goat his Nurſe. Such another God was <hi>Saturn,</hi> a cruel Murtherer of his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and whoſe chief delight was to have little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſacrificed to him. What was <hi>Mercury</hi> but a Thief, <hi>Venus</hi> a Whore, <hi>Bacchus</hi> a Drunkard, <hi>Vulcan</hi> was but a Smith, <hi>Apollo</hi> a Shepheard and Maſon, <hi>Mars</hi> a Souldier, <hi>Neptune</hi> a Marriner, <hi>Minerva</hi> a Spinſter or Weaver, <hi>Saturn</hi> a Husband-man, <hi>Eſeulapius</hi> a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? ſo as that they had no other Deity but what were Men, and the loweſt of Men too. And no leſs abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable was their Cruelty in their Sacrifices and Offerings; for, there was a brazen Statue of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s at <hi>Carthage,</hi> with hands ſomewhat lifted up; the Statue it ſelf was open, hallow, and bending towards the Earth, a Man or Youth was ſolemnly laid upon theſe Arms, and thence he was ſtreight tumbled down head-long into a burning Furnace that was flaming underneath. This burning alive was beſtowed upon that God yearly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſet day, and at other times alſo, even with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed Victims, eſpecially in caſe of any great Calamity that ſhould befall the City. Accordingly upon the Slaughter they received by <hi>Agathocles,</hi> they made a Decree, (I tremble to ſpeak it) to offer up two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of their nobleſt Youths in this manner to <hi>Saturn;</hi> and who would believe it, there were as many more who freely offered themſelves to the ſame Death.</p>
            <p n="2">II. So great a Reverence to Religion had the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> Kings, to the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that whenſoever the Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who was worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in <hi>Meroc,</hi> declar'd to any of them that his Life was hateful to the Gods, he immediately put an end to his days; nor was there any of them found to have had a more tender Regard to the Safety of his own Life than he had Reverence to Religion; till King <hi>Arganes,</hi> who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46445:6"/>leſt the Prieſts ſhould tell him he ſhould dye, began with themſelves, put them all to Death firſt, and thereby aboliſhed the Cuſtom. At <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> was a magnificent Temple, where men uſed to geld themſelves and put on Womens Apparel; ſuch Prieſts were called <hi>Galli:</hi> Here ſtood two, <hi>Priapi</hi> or <hi>Phalli,</hi> and within the Quire, (into which the Chief Prieſt only might enter) ſtood <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Statue, ſupported with Bulls, <hi>Juno</hi>'s with Lyons, having in one hand a Scepter, and a Diſtaff in the other. In the Temple ſtood <hi>Apollo,</hi> whoſe Oracles were much conſulted; if the Petition was liked the Image would move forward, if otherwiſe, backward. They had divers Feaſts, the greateſt was that of the <hi>Fire,</hi> where they ſet divers Trees, hung with divers ſorts of Beaſt for Sacrifice on Fire, after they had carryed about theſe Fires (in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) to their Idols. Here the gelded Prieſts wound each other, and divers young men at this Feaſt geld themſelves. Here was much confuſed Muſick, Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Fury, and Prophecyings. Into the Temple none might enter in thirty days in whoſe Family any died, and then his Head muſt be ſhaved. He that but look'd upon a dead Corps was excluded the Temple a whole day. To touch a Dove was Abomination, becauſe <hi>Semiramis</hi> was transformed into a Dove; and ſo it was to touch Fiſhes, becauſe of <hi>Dercito,</hi> the Mermaid and Mother of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> half a Fiſh and half a Woman. To <hi>Hierapolis</hi> were divers Pilgrimages; each Pilgrim was bound to cut his Hair on his Head and Brows, to ſacrifice a Sheep, to lay the Head and Feet of the Sheep upon his own Head, to crown himſelf, to drink cold Water only, and to ſleep on the Ground till his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: the young men were bound to conſecrate their Hair, then to cut it in the Temple, and to offer it in a Box of Gold and Silver, with their Names inſcribed thereon. The <hi>Phaenicians</hi> were bound to offer yearly Sacrifices of young Children to <hi>Saturn,</hi> and in the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> to practice not only Whoredom but

In the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> were celebrated the annual Rites of <hi>Adonis,</hi> with Beatings and Howlings, to whom they performed ſolemn Obſequies. The <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> worſhipped the Sun and Moon, Serpents, Trees, and other ſuch like Deities. The <hi>Nabathaeans</hi> burned Frankincenſe to the Sun or his Altar; they do not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Dead, but lay 'em, even their Kings, on Dunghils. Adultery is Death among 'em, but Inceſt is no Sin. In <hi>Panchaea</hi> is a rich ſtately Temple, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Statues, and the Prieſts ruled all there both in politick and eccleſiaſtick Affairs.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> had neither Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, nor Images, holding theſe improper for their Gods; but on the tops of Hills offered Sacrifices to Heaven, and to the Sun, Moon, Fire, Earth, Water, and Winds. The Prieſts uſed neither Muſick, Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor Libaments, but only his Tiara or Head-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, crowned with Mirtle. To Lye and be in Debt are heinous Crimes with them; ſo it is to ſpit, waſh, or piſs in a River, which with them are hallowed. The old <hi>Scythians</hi> had neither Temples, Images, nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, for any of their Gods, except for <hi>Mars,</hi> whoſe Temples they erected of bundles of Twigs heaped up together: Inſtead of his Image they ſet up an old Iron Sword, to which they offered yearly Sacrifices of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and Horſes, and of Men every hundredth Captive, with whoſe Blood they beſprinkled <hi>Mars</hi>'s Sword; then they cut off the right Shoulders of the ſlain men, and fling them into the Air: they uſed to wound firſt, and then to ſtrangle the Beaſt which they ſacrificed, praying to that God to whom they offered the Beaſt: they kindled no Fire of Wood, for the Country yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none; but they burned the Bones of the Beaſt to boyl the Fleſh withal; if they want a Veſſel they boyl the Fleſh in the Beaſt's Paunch; they uſe no Vows, nor any other Ceremonies.</p>

            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Tartars</hi> worſhipped the Sun, Stars, Fire, Earth, and Water, to whom they offered the firſt Fruits of their Meat and Drink each morning before they eat and drink themſelves. They believe there is one God, Maker of all things, yet they worſhip not nor pray unto him. They place Idols at the Tent doors: theſe Idols being made of Silk and Felt, are offered the firſt Fruits of Milk, Meat, and Drink; the Hearts alſo of Beaſts, which they leave before them all night, and then eat them in the morning: they offer Horſes to the Emperour's Idol, which none afterward muſt ride; they do not break, but burn the Bones of their Sacrifices; by their Diſcipline they muſt not touch the Fire with a Knife, nor meddle with young Birds, nor pour Milk, Drink, or Meat, on the ground, nor break one Bone with another, nor make Water within their Tents, with divers other ſuch Traditions, which if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated, are puniſhed with Death, or elſe redeemed with much Money. They believe another World, but ſuch as this. When one dyeth he hath Meat ſet before him, and Mare's Milk, his Friends eat a Horſe, and burn the Bones thereof for his Soul; they bury alſo with him a Mare, a Colt, and a Horſe, bridled and ſadled, his Gold and Silver alſo; and they ſet upon Poles the Horſe Hide that was eat, that he may not be without a Tent in the other World. They uſe to feed the Ghoſts or Spirits with Mares Milk caſt in the Air, or poured on the Ground. They have their religious Votaries or Monaſteries, amongſt which there is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der called <hi>Senſchin,</hi> which eat nothing but Bran ſteeped in hot Water. They do not worſhip Idols, nor do they marry, but they hold Tranſanimation, and divers other ridiculous Opinions. They have a ſtrange Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among them, that their Prieſts on high Trees preach to them, and after Sermon beſprinkle their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors with Blood, Milk, Earth, and Cow-dung, mixed together: and no leſs ſtrange it is, that they do not bury their Dead but hang them upon Trees. But the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46445:7"/>
               <hi>Tartars</hi> were not all of one Religion; for as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſeveral Nations, ſo they had ſeveral Sects in their Paganiſm. Before the Corps of any great Man they ſet a Table, furniſhed with all ſorts of meats; with the Odour of which, they think the departed Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and heartned againſt the burning of the Body. They caſt into the Fire, with the Body, Pictures of his Men, Women, and Horſes, and other things to ſerve in the other World.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Inhabitants of <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> worſhip the Sun ſo long as he is with them, and in his abſence the Moon and the North-Star, having no Religion preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them by Law. To the Northern Star they offer a yearly Sacrifice of their Deer, which they burn, except their Head and Feet: they ſacrifice alſo for their Dead. The <hi>Samodyes,</hi> which are ſubject to the <hi>Zar</hi> of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> are much addicted to Witchcraft and Idolatry; among them, each Kindred have their Temple, where they ſacrifice. Their Prieſt is he that is eldeſt, whoſe Ornaments are ſmall Ribs and Teeth of Fiſhes and Wild Beaſts hanging about them, with a white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on his Head; in his Divine Service he doth not ſing, but howl, and that ſo long, till he become like a Mad-man, and then falls down as though he were dead, but riſeth again, ordereth five Deer to be ſacrificed, and thruſts a Sword half way into his Belly, ſtill ſinging, or howling rather; the Sword he takes out again, heats it in the Fire, and then thruſts it in at the Navel, and out at the Fundament; then he lets two Women, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him, pull off his Head and left Shoulder, with a ſmall Line by which they pull the Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a Kettle of hot Water; but he reviveth again, and cometh out whole as he was before. In <hi>Samogitia,</hi> a ſmall Province between <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> the Inhabitants nouriſh among them a kind of four-footed Serpents, about three handfuls in length, which they worſhip as their Houſhold Gods, attending them with Fear and Reverence when they call them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46445:8"/>out to their Repaſts; and if any miſchance do happen to any of the Family, it is imputed preſently to ſome want of due Obſervance of theſe ugly Creatures. They are naturally inclined to Divinations, Charms, and Sorceries, and frequently abuſed, as for the moſt part ſuch People are, by diabolical Illuſions. The <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> anciently had Fire and Serpents for their Gods, nouriſhing the laſt in their Houſes, and keeping the other continually burning; the Prieſts and Miniſters of the Temple always adding Fewel, that it might not fail: the <hi>Veſtal</hi> Fire was not kept more carefully at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor with greater Ceremony. To this God whom they called <hi>Diſhpan,</hi> or the <hi>Lord of the Smoak,</hi> they uſed to ſacrifice young Pullets, to the other, Cocks.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Saracens</hi> in old time adored the Star of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> they worſhipped likewiſe the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> ſet on a great Stone, on which they believed that <hi>Abraham</hi> lay with <hi>Hagar,</hi> or elſe that he tyed his Camel thereunto while he was ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac.</hi> In the beginning of Spring, and in the beginning of <hi>Autumn,</hi> the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> uſed to caſt Stones upon heaps, being naked and bare-headed, with Cryes, and going about their Idols, kiſſing the Corners in honour of their Gods. This they uſed at <hi>Mecca,</hi> in honour of <hi>Venus;</hi> and therefore in that Solemnity did they caſt Stones under their Privities, becauſe thoſe Parts were under her Dominion; only, whereas Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs was immodeſt, ſome ordained that they ſhould bind a Cloath about their Reins. This <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, and did not reject, as he did ſome other idolatrous Rites, but in their Pilgrimage Rites they ſtill obſerve it. The <hi>Moxi,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Tartars,</hi> at a certain time in the Year, take a Horſe, which they ſet in the Field, with his four Legs tyed to four Poſts, and his Head to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Poſt faſtned in the Ground; This done, one of them ſtanding at a convenient Diſtance, ſhooteth him to the Heart; afterwards they ſlay him, and obſerving certain Ceremonies about the Fleſh, eat the ſame.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46445:8"/>The Skin they fill with <hi>Chaff,</hi> and in each of his Legs thruſt a ſtreight Stick, that he may ſtand upright as if he were alive; laſtly, they go to a great Tree, and lop there from as many Boughs as they think good, and make a Room or Seller in that tree, where they ſet this Horſe on his Feet, and worſhip him, offering unto him Foxes and divers Beaſts which bear rich Furrs; of which Offerings the Trees hang full. There are another ſort of <hi>Tartars</hi> who worſhip the Sun, as they do alſo a red Cloath faſtned to the top of a Pole, and eat Serpents, Worms, and other Filth.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Inhabitants of <hi>Baſcia,</hi> a Province lying ſomewhat to the South of <hi>Tartary,</hi> are Idolaters and Magicians, cruel and deceitful, living on Fleſh and Rice. Scarce a days Journey from hence is <hi>Cheſmur,</hi> the People whereof are wickedly cunning in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Arts, by which they cauſe the dumb Idols to ſpeak, the day to grow dark, and other marvellous things, being the Well-ſpring of Idols and Idolatry in thoſe parts, They have Hermites after their Law, which abide in their Monaſteries, are very abſtinent in eating and drinking, contain their Bodies in ſtreight Chaſtity, and are very careful to abſtain from ſuch Sins wherewith they think their Idols offended, and live long. In the Province of <hi>Tanguth,</hi> bordering likewiſe upon <hi>Tartary,</hi> their Temples are made like the <hi>Christians,</hi> capable of four or five thouſand Perſons. In them are two Images of a Man and Woman, lying in length forty foot, all of one Peice, or Stone; for which uſe, they have Carts with forty Wheels, drawn by five or ſix hundred Horſes and Mules, two or three Months Journey. They have alſo little Images with ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heads, and ten Hands, holding in each of them ſeveral things, as a Serpent, Bird, Flower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have Monaſteries, wherein are men of Holy Life, never coming forth, but have food carryed them thither daily: their Gates are walled up, and there are an infinity of Fryer-like Companions paſſing to and fro in their Cities.

               <hi>Caindu</hi> is a Heatheniſh Nation, where, in honour of their Idols, they proſtitute their Wives, Siſters, and Daughters, to the Luſt of Travellers; which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the Houſe, the good man departeth, and the Woman ſetteth ſome Token over the Door, which there remaineth as long as this Stallion Stranger, for a ſign to her Husband not to return till the Gueſt be as well gone from her Houſe as Honeſty from her Heart, and Wit from his Head. In <hi>Cailar</hi> and <hi>Cailocoram</hi> are ſuch monſtrous huge Idols, that it is reported, ſome of 'em may be ſeen two days before a man comes at 'em.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And now I will proceed to give an Account of the Gods and Religion of <hi>China;</hi> and begin with what <hi>Odoricus</hi> affirmeth, That at <hi>Kaiton</hi> or <hi>Zaiton,</hi> he found two Convents of <hi>Minorite</hi> Fryers, and many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries of Idolaters; in one whereof he was, in which, as it was told him, were three thouſand Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and eleven thouſand Idols: one of thoſe Idols, leſs than ſome others, was as big as a Popiſh St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher.</hi> Theſe Idols they feed every day with the ſmoak of hot Meats ſet before them, but the Meat they eat themſelves. At <hi>Quinſay,</hi> a <hi>Chineze</hi> conveyed him into a certain Monaſtery, where he called to a Religious Perſon, and ſaid, this <hi>Raban Francus,</hi> that is, this Religious <hi>French-man,</hi> cometh from the Sun-ſetting, and is now going to <hi>Cambaleth</hi> to pray for the Life of the Great <hi>Chan,</hi> and therefore you muſt ſhew him ſome ſtrange ſight: then the ſaid Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon took great Baſkets full of broken Reliques, and led me into a little walled Park, and unlocked the door: we entered into a fair Green, wherein was a Mount in form of a Steeple, repleniſhed with Herbs and Trees; then did he ring with a Bell, at the ſound whereof, many Creatures, like Apes, Cats, and Monkeys, came down the Mount, and ſome had Faces like Men, to the number of four thouſand, and two hundred, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves in good order, before whom he ſet
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46445:9"/>a Platter, and gave them thoſe Fragments; which, when they had eaten, he rung the ſecond time, and they all returned to their former places. I wondered at the ſight, and demanded what Creatures they were; they are, ſaid he, the Souls of Noble-men, which we here feed for the love of God, who governeth the World. And as a man was honourable in his Life, ſo his Soul entreth after Death into the Body of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Beaſt; but the Souls of ſimple and ruſtical Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple poſſeſs the Bodies of more vile and bruitiſh Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Neither could I diſſwade him from the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or perſwade him that any Soul might remain without a Body.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>Gaſper de la Crux</hi> being in <hi>Canton,</hi> a City of <hi>China,</hi> entred a certain Religious Houſe, where he ſaw a Chappel, having therein, beſides many of her things of great Curioſity, the Image of a Woman with a Child hanging about her Neck, and a Lamp burning before her. The Myſtery hereof none of the <hi>Chinezes</hi> could declare. The Sun, Moon, Stars, and eſpecially Heaven it ſelf, are Gods of the firſt form in their Idol School. They acknowledge <hi>Laocon Tzanter,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Great God, (ſo it ſignifieth) to be eternal and a Spirit. Of like Nature they eſteem <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</hi> unto whom they aſcribe the lower Heaven, and power of Life and Death: they ſubject unto him three other Spirits, <hi>Tauquam, Teyquam, Tzuiquam,</hi> the firſt ſuppoſed to be Author of Rain, the ſecond of Humane Nativity, Husbandry, and Wars, the third is their Sea <hi>Neptune:</hi> to theſe they offer Victuals, Odours, and Altar Cloaths, preſenting them alſo with Plays and Comedies. They have Images of the Devil, with Serpentine Locks, and as deformed Looks as here he is painted; whom they worſhip, not to obtain any good at his hand, but to detain and hold his hand from doing them evil. They have many he and ſhe Saints in great Veneration, with long Legends of their Lives. Amongſt the chief of them are <hi>Sichia,</hi> the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46445:10"/>firſt Inventer of their Religious Votaries of both Sects; <hi>Quannia</hi> an <hi>Anchoreſs;</hi> and <hi>Neoma,</hi> a great <hi>Sorcereſs.</hi> Fryer <hi>Martin,</hi> in one Temple in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chco,</hi> told a hundred and twelve Idols. They tell of one <hi>Hujanſin</hi> in the Province of <hi>Cechiam,</hi> which did much good to the People, both by Alchimy, making true Silver of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and by freeing the Metropolitan City from a huge Dragon, which he faſtened to an Iron Pillar, ſtill ſhewed, and then flew into Heaven with all his Houſe Mice and all, Lye and all, and there they have built him a Temple; the Miniſters whereof, are of that Sect. <hi>Thauſu</hi> and <hi>Trigautius</hi> writes of certain Gods called <hi>Foe,</hi> which they ſay go a viſiting Cities and Provinces; and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in one City were taken for theſe Idols <hi>Foe.</hi> At <hi>Sciauchim,</hi> they in time of Drought proclaimed a Faſt, every Idol was ſollicited with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Odours, for Rain; a peculiar Officer with the Elders of the People, obſerved peculiar Rites to this purpoſe, the Prieſts went on Proceſſion all in vain. When the City-Gods could do nothing, they fetched a Country Idol, called <hi>Locu,</hi> which they carry about, worſhip, and offer to: but <hi>Locu</hi> is now grown old; thus they ſaid of his Deafneſs: at laſt they go to a Witch, who told them, <hi>Quonim,</hi> a Goddeſs, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that her Back was burned, meaning the Converts which burn'd their Idols; which incenſed them againſt the Chriſtians. <hi>Hoaquim</hi> is the name of an Idol, which hath rule over the Eyes, which they carry about in Proceſſion, and beg in his name. In time of Trouble they have Familiarity with the Devil. <hi>Pedro de Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fero</hi> obſerved, being in a Ship with a <hi>Chineze,</hi> in this ſort; They cauſe a man to lye on the Ground grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and then one readeth on a Book, the reſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and ſome make a ſound with Bells and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. The man in ſhort ſpace beginneth to make Viſages and Geſtures, whereby they know the Devil is entred, and then do they propound their Requeſts, to which he anſwereth by a Word or Letters. And when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46445:10"/>they cannot extort an anſwer by Word, they ſpread a red Mantle on the Ground, equally diſperſing all over the ſame a certain quantity of Rice: then do they cauſe a man, that cannot write, to ſtand there, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves renewing their former Invocation; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil entring into this man cauſeth him to write upon the Rice: but his Anſwers are often full of Lies. In the Entries of their Houſes they have an Idol Room, where they incenſe their Deities Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they offer to them the ſweeteſt Odours, Hens, Geeſe, Ducks, Rice, Wine; a Hogs-head boyled is the chief Offering; but little hereof falleth to the God's ſhare, which is ſet in a Diſh apart, as the tips of the Hogs Ears, the Bylls and Feet of the Hens, a few Corns of Rice, three or four drops of Wine: their Books tell much of Hell; their Devotions little. Their Temples are homely and filthy, no Oracle is in any of them; they have Fables of men turned into Dogs or Snakes, and again metamorphoſed into men: and they which believe the Pains of Hell, yet believe, after a certain ſpace, that thoſe damned Souls ſhall paſs thence into the Bodies of Beaſts. But their Idolatries and religious Rites will better appear, if we take a view of their different Religions and Sects.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The <hi>Chinezes</hi> do conceive thus of the Creation, That there was one <hi>Taine,</hi> who created <hi>Panzon</hi> and <hi>Paullina,</hi> whoſe Poſterity remained ninety thouſand Years; but they, for their Wickedneſs, being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Taine</hi> created <hi>Luitzam,</hi> who had two Horns, from the right came men, from the left came Women. They are very much afraid when there is any Eclipſe of the Sun or Moon, which they hold to be man or Wife; for then they think that theſe two Gods are angry with them. In <hi>Canada</hi> the Natives worſhip the Devil, who when he is offended with them, flings Duſt in their Eyes. The men marry two or three Wives, who after the Death of their Husbands never marry again, but go ſtill in black, and beſinear their Faces with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46445:11"/>Coal-Duſt and Greeſe: they do firſt expoſe their Daughters to any that will lye with them, and then give them in Marriage. They believe, that after Death their Souls aſcend unto the Stars, and go down with them under the Horriſon, into a Paradiſe of Pleaſure: They believe alſo, that God ſtuck a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Arrows in the Beginning, into the Ground, and of theſe ſprung up Men and Women. They have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ridiculous Opinions of God, as, That he once drank much Tobacco, and then gave the Pipe to their Governour, with a Command that he ſhould keep it carefully, and ſo doing, he ſhould want nothing; but he loſt the Pipe, and ſo fell into Want and Miſery. They uſe to ſing to the Devils, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; to dance about Fires which they make to his Honour, and leap over them. They bemoan the Dead a great while, and bring Preſents to their Graves. In <hi>Florida</hi> the Chief Deities are the Sun and Moon, which they honour with Dances and Songs. Once a Year they offer to the Sun a Harts-hide ſtuffed with Herbs, hanging Garlands of Fruits about his Horns, ſo preſenting this Gift toward the Eaſt, they pray the Sun to make the Land produce the ſame Fruits again: but to their Kings they uſe to ſacrifice their firſt-born Males; much of their Devotion, like the reſt of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Savages, conſiſting in ſinging, dancing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, feaſting, and cutting off their own Skins. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the Woman is puniſhed with whipping. In ſome parts of this Country the next of Kin is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cut the Adultereſſes Throat, and the Woman to cut the Adulterers Throat. In ſome parts alſo of the Country they worſhip the Devil; who when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of Thirſt, humane Blood is ſhed to quench his Thirſt. When a King is buryed, the Cup wherein he uſed to drink is ſtill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46445:11"/>are hired, who for ſix Months howl for him three times a day. This honour the King and Prieſt have, that they are buried in their Houſes, and burned with their Houſes and Goods.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. In <hi>Mexico,</hi> beſides their inferiour Prieſts they had one Chief, whoſe Habit was a Crown of rich Feathers on his Head, Pendants of Gold with green Stones at his Ears, and under his Lips an azure Stone. His Office was to receive the Body of the Dead King at the Temple door with a mournful Song, to open the Breaſt of the ſacrificed Man, to pull out his Heart to offer it to the Sun, and then to fling that to the Idol to which the man was ſanctified: The inferiour Prieſts in the interim, holding the Legs, Arms, and Head of the ſacrificed Wretch, whilſt his Heart was taking out. They uſed alſo to flay off the Skins of men, and cloath ſome therewith, who went about dancing, and forcing People to offer them Preſents or elſe they would ſtrike them over the face with the bloody Corner of the Skin. The Prieſts Office alſo was to burn Incenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Idols every Morning, Noon-tide, Evening, and at Mid-night, for then, with Trumpets and Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets they ſounded a long time; which done, they burned the Incenſe in Cenſures with much Reverence, and then they beat themſelves and draw Blood with ſharp Bodkins; they preach alſo on ſome Feſtival days to the People. The Revenues of the Prieſts were great: the Temples, in State, Magnificence, and Wealth, exceed ours. The Prieſts were all anointed, and wear their Hair long, for they never cut it. They did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times anoint themſelves with an Unguent made of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Beaſts, which made them without fear, and armed them with Cruelty. They painted their Skins black; they waſhed their new born Children, and let them Blood in their Ears: they performed Marriages by aſking the Parties mutual Conſent, and tying toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Corner of the Womans Vail with the Corner of the Man's Gown, and ſo brought them to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46445:12"/>groom's Houſe, cauſing the Bride to go ſeven times about the Hearth. They buried the dead either in their Gardens or on Mountains; ſometimes they burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Body: and if he was a great man they killed his Chaplain and his Officers to attend him, burying alſo Wealth with him, that he might not want in the other World. The Prieſt uſed to attire himſelf in theſe great Funerals, like a Devil, with many Mouths, and glaſs Eyes, and with his Staff ſtirred and mingled the Aſhes. When the King dyed the Prieſts were to ſing his Elogies, and to ſacrifice two hundred Perſons to ſerve him. Adultery was puniſhed with Death, and ſo was Diſhoneſty in their Nuns and Monks, of which there were two great Cloyſters at <hi>Mexico.</hi>

            <p n="13">XIII. The <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> believed commonly, That the Souls lived after this Life, and that the Good were in Glory and the Bad in Pain; ſo as there is little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to perſwade them to theſe Articles. But they are not yet come to the Knowledge of that point, that the Bodies ſhould riſe with the Souls: and therefore they did uſe a wonderful Care to preſerve the Bodies, which they honoured after Death. To this end their Succeſſors gave them Garments, and made Sacrifices unto them, eſpecially the King's <hi>Inguas,</hi> being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied at their Funerals with a great number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Women for their Service in the other Life: and therefore on the day of his deceaſe they did put to death the Woman he had loved beſt, his Servants and Officers, that they might ſerve him in the other Life. When as <hi>Guanacapa</hi> died (who was Father to <hi>Atagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They did ſacrifice many things unto them, eſpecially young Children, and with the Blood they made a ſtroak on the dead man's Face from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46445:12"/>one Ear to the other. This Superſtition and Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to kill both Men and Women to accompany and ſerve the Dead in the other Life, hath been followed by others, and is at this day uſed amongſt ſome other barbarous Nations. And as <hi>Apollo</hi> writes, it hath been in a manner general throughout all the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Reverend <hi>Beda</hi> reports, That before the <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> were converted to the Goſpel, they had the ſame Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, to kill men to accompany and ſerve the dead. It is written of a <hi>Portugal</hi> who being Captive among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> had been hurt with a Dart, ſo as he loſt one Eye, and as they would have ſacrificed him to accompany a Noble-man that was dead, he ſaid unto them, That thoſe that were in the other Life would make ſmall account of the dead if they gave him a blind man for a Companion; and that it were better to give him an Attendant that had both his Eyes: this Reaſon being found good by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they let him go. Beſides this Superſtition of ſacrificing Men to the Dead, being uſed but to great Perſonages, there is another far more general and common in all the <hi>Indies;</hi> which is, to ſet Meat and Drink upon the Grave of the dead, imagining they did feed thereon; the which hath been an Error amongſt the Ancients, as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> writes, and therefore they gave them Meat and Drink. At this day many <hi>Indian</hi> Infidels do ſecretly draw their dead out of the Church-yard, and bury them on Hills, or upon Paſſages of Mountains, or elſe in their own Houſes. They have alſo uſed to put Gold and Silver in their Mouth, Hands, and Boſom, and to apparel them with new Garments, durable, and well lined under the Herſe. They believe that the Souls of the dead wandred up and down, and endured Cold, Thirſt, Hunger, and Travel; and for this Cauſe they make their Anniverſaries, carrying them Cloaths, Meat, and Drink.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. The Kings <hi>Inguas</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> cauſed Images to be made to their Likeneſs, which they called <hi>Guacos,</hi> or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46445:13"/>Brothers, cauſing them for to be honoured like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which was in this ſort. They took a Captive, ſuch as they thought good, and before they did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto him their Idols, they gave him the Name of the Idol to whom he ſhould be ſacrificed, and apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Ornaments like their Idol, ſaying, that he did repreſent the ſame Idol: and during the time that this Repreſentation laſted, which was for a Year in ſome Feaſts, in others ſix months, and in others leſs: they reverenced and worſhipped him in the ſame manner as the proper Idol, and in the mean time he did eat, drink, and was merry. When he went through the Streets the People came forth to worſhip him, and every one brought him an Alms, with Children, and ſick Folks, that he might cure them and bleſs them, ſuffering him to do all things at his Pleaſure, only he was accompanyed with ten or twelve Men leſt he ſhould fly. And he, to the end he might be reverenced as he paſſed, ſometimes ſounded upon a ſmall Flute, that the People might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to worſhip him. The Feaſt being come, and he grown fat, they killed him, opened him, and eat him, making a ſolemn Sacrifice of him.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The chief Idol of <hi>Mexico</hi> was <hi>Vitziliputzli;</hi> It was an Image of Wood like to a <hi>Mars</hi> ſet upon a Stool of the Colour of Azure, in a Brankard or Litter; at every Corner was a piece of Wood in form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head. The Stool fignified that he was ſet in Heaven; this Idol had all the Fore-head azure, and had a Band of azure under the Noſe, from one Ear to the other; upon his Head he had a rich Plume of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, like to the Beak of a ſmall Bird, the which was covered on the top with Gold burniſhed very brown; he had in his Left hand a white Target, with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of five Pine-apples made of white Feathers, ſet in a Croſs, and from above iſſued forth a Creſt of Gold, and at his Sides he had four Darts, which (the <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay) had been ſent from Heaven for the doing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46445:13"/>mighty Acts and Proweſſes; in his Right hand he had an azured Staff, cut in faſhion of a waving Snake.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. The People of <hi>Peru</hi>'s chief God was <hi>Wiracho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi> by whom they underſtood the Maker of all things; next to him they worſhipped the Sun and the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after him: the Images of thoſe three they never touched with their bare hands: they worſhipped all the Stars, Earth, Sea, Rain-bow, Rivers, Fountains, and Trees. They adored alſo wild Beaſts, that they might not hurt them; and in ſign of their Devotion, when they travelled they left in the Croſs-way and dangerous Places, old Shoes, Feathers, and if they had nothing elſe, Stones. They worſhipped the Sun, by pulling off the Hairs from their Eye-brows. When they fear, they touch the Earth, and look up to the Sun: they worſhip alſo the dead Bodies of their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and indeed, every thing they either affected or feared. They have ſome glimmering Knowledge of the beginning of the World, of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, and they believe the end of the World, which they ſtill fear when the Sun is eclipſed, which they think to be the Moon's Husband: they held their Prieſts in ſuch eſteem, that no great matter was undertaken by Prince or People without their Advice. None had Acceſs to their Idols but they, and then only when they are cloathed in white, and proſtrate on the Ground. In ſacrificing they abſtain from Women, and ſome out of Zeal would put out their own Eyes. They uſed to conſult with the Devil to whom they ſacrificed men and dedicated Boys in their Temples for Sodomy. They had alſo their Temples richly adorned with Gold and Silver, and their Monaſteries for Prieſts and Sorcerers. Their Nuns were ſo ſtrictly kept, that it was Death to be deflowred: after fourteen years of age they were taken out of the Monaſtery, either to ſerve their Idols (and ſuch muſt be Virgins ſtill) or elſe to ſerve as Wives and Concubines to the <hi>Ingua</hi> or Emperour. They are very frequent and ſtrict in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46445:14"/>their Confeſſions, and chearfully undertake what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is enjoyned them: but the <hi>Ingua</hi> confeſſeth only to the Sun. After Confeſſion they all waſh in Baths, leaving their Sins in the Water; they uſed to ſacrifice Vegitables, Animals, and Men, chiefly Children, for the Health or Proſperity of their <hi>Ingua,</hi> and for Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in War. In ſome places they eat their man Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, in others they only dryed and preſerved them in Silver Coffins; they anoint with Blood the Faces of their Idols and Doors of their Temples, or rather, Slaughter-houſes.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> planted Chriſtianity in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Natives worſhipped the Devil and many Idols, as yet they do in many places there. They believe many Gods, but one principally, who made the reſt, and that all Creatures were made of Water, and the Woman before the Man, who by help of one of the Gods, conceived and bore Children. They are all <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> giving to their Gods the form of Men, whom they worſhip with praiſing, ſinging, and Offerings. They hold the Souls Immortality, Rewards and Puniſhments after this Life, the one in Heaven, the other in a burning Pit towards the Weſt. The Prieſts are diſtinguiſhed from other People by Garments of Skin, and their Hair cut like a Comb on their Crowns. They carry their Gods about with them, and ask Counſel of them. Much of their Devotions conſiſted in howling and dancing about Fires, with Rattles, or Gourd, or Pompian Rinds in their hands, beating the ground with Stones, and offering Tobacco, Deers Suet, and Blood on the Stone Altars. They undertake no matters of Conſequence without advice of their Prieſts, the chief whereof, is adorned with Feathers and Weaſels Tails, and his Face painted as ugly as the Devils. They bury their Kings (after their Bodies are burned and dryed) in white Skins, within Arches and Mats, with their Wealth at their Feet, and by the Body is placed the Devils Image: the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46445:14"/>expreſs their Sorrow with black Paint and Yellings for twenty four hours. None but the King and Prieſt may enter theſe Houſes where the Images of Devils, and their Kings, are kept. Inſtead of ſaying Grace at Meat they fling the firſt Bit into the Fire; and when they will appeaſe a Storm they caſt Tobacco into the Water: ſometimes they ſacrifice Children to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. In <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> they worſhipped the Sun and Moon, which they ſay at firſt ſhined out of a Cave; and their Tradition is, That out of two Caves came Mankind; the biggeſt men out of the greateſt Cave, and the leaſt men out of the leſſer Cave. They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alſo divers Idols with ugly Shapes, by which the Devil uſeth to ſpeak to them; theſe they call <hi>Zermes,</hi> to which they kept divers Feſtivals. In theſe they had their publick Dances, with the Muſick of Shells tyed about their Arms, Thighs, and Legs. The King fits drumming, when the People preſent themſelves, having their Skins painted with divers Colours of Herbs. When they ſacrifice they uſe with a ſacred Hook to thruſt down their Throats to turn up their Stomachs: then they ſitdown in a Ring croſs-legged and wry-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Idol, praying their Sacrifice might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. In ſome places the Women dance about their Idols, and ſing the Prayers of their ancient Kings; then both Sexes, on their Knees, offer Cakes, which the Prieſts cut, and give to every one a piece: this each Man keeps as a Relick againſt Dangers. If any fall ſick, the Prieſts impute this to their neglect in the Idol's Service; therefore exhort them to build a Chappel, or dedicate a Grove to their God: they think the Ghoſts of the dead walk, who aſſault ſuch as are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and vaniſh from them who are not afraid.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. In <hi>Malabar</hi> they have a <hi>Pagod</hi> or Idol, which they worſhip, ſeated upon a brazen Throne, and crowned with a rich Diadem: From his Head iſſue out four Horns, from his Mouth four Tuſks, his Eyes fiery,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46445:15"/>like a Glow-worm, his Noſe flat and ugly, his Viſage terrible, his Hands like Claws, his Legs and Thighs like thoſe of a Lion; in a word, we cannot paint the Devil in a more ugly Figure than they do their God. Unto this <hi>Pagod</hi> or his <hi>Priest,</hi> they offer the Virginity of all their Daughters; the <hi>Pagod</hi> having, in the place of his Privy Parts, a Bodkin of Gold or Silver, upon which the Bride (marryed moſt commonly at ten or twelve years of Age) is forcibly ſet; the ſharpneſs of it being ſuch, that it forceth out the Blood in great Abundance; and if ſhe prove with Child that Year, it is ſaid to be of his begetting, and the more eſteemed. Others with more Humanity, inſtead of torturing their Daughters on this wretched Idol, (paralel almoſt to the offering their Sons to <hi>Moloch</hi> amongſt the <hi>Syrians</hi>) preſent them to the <hi>Bramini</hi> or <hi>Idol-Priest,</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured the firſt Night of the Wedding and without one of theſe two Handſels no man is ſuffered to enjoy the uſe of his Wife; not their Kings themſelves. More priviledged yet than many VVomen neighbouring on them, in that they are not compelled to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Husbands Bodies, but may have many Husbands, either ſucceſſively or at once, as they liſt themſelves: and if at once, ſhe ſends her Children to that Husband (as we know who did) who ſhe thinks to have the beſt right to them.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. The former Story brings to mind a Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> which took beginning, as the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Hiſtorians affirm, in the Reign of <hi>Ewen</hi> the Third, who is the fifteenth King in their Catalogue, after the firſt <hi>Fergus.</hi> This <hi>Ewen</hi> being a Prince much addicted, or wholly rather given over unto laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, made a Law, that himſelf and his Succeſſors ſhould have the <hi>Maiden-Head</hi> or firſt Nights Lodging with every VVoman whoſe Husband held Land imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the Crown; and the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of all thoſe whoſe Husbands were their Tenants or <hi>Homagers.</hi> This was it ſeems the Knights Service,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46445:15"/>which men held their Eſtates by, and continued till the days of <hi>Malcolm Commor,</hi> who at the Requeſt of his VVife <hi>Margaret,</hi> (ſhe was the Siſter of <hi>Edgar Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>) aboliſhed this Law, and ordained, That the <hi>Tenants,</hi> by way of Commutation, ſhould pay unto their Lords a Mark in Money; which Tributes, the Hiſtorians ſay, is ſtill in force.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. In <hi>Loango,</hi> a Country under the Line, they worſhip Idols, and are circumciſed. Every Tradeſman appeaſeth his God with ſuch things as belong to his Trade; the Husband-man with Corn, the VVeaver with Cloath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At the Death of their Friends they kill Goats, to the honour of their Idols, and make divers Feaſts in memorial of the dead. They will rather dye than touch any Meat which is prohibited by their Prieſts. At <hi>Keaga,</hi> the Sea-Port of <hi>Loango,</hi> there is an Idol kept by an old VVoman, which is once a Year honoured with great Solemnity and feaſting. There is another Idol at <hi>Morumba,</hi> thirty Leagues Northward, where Boys are ſworn to ſerve this God, and are initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with hard Diet, ten days Silence, Abſtinence from certain Meats, and a Cut in their Shoulder, the Blood of which, is ſprinkled at the Idol's Feet. Their Tryals of Life and Death are in the Preſence of this Idol. At <hi>Anzichi</hi> they are circumciſed, worſhip the Sun and Moon, and each man his particular Idol. In ſome of theſe neighbouring Countries the People are Man-eaters and worſhip the Devil, to whom they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sacrifice, which they continue from Morning till Night, uſing charming Vociferations, dancing and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> is likewiſe profeſſed in <hi>Guinea,</hi> for they adore ſtrawen things, inſtead of God, of whom they ſpeak blaſphemouſly, calling him evil, black, and the Author of their Miſeries; and that they are no ways beholding to him for what they enjoy, but to their own Induſtry. They put within their Rings, Wheat, Water, and Oyl, for their God to feed upon: ſuch
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46445:16"/>Rings are worn by many, as Preſervatives againſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Their Prieſts uſe to preach to them on Feſtival days, and after Sermon to beſprinkle the Infants with Water, in which a Newt doth ſwim. They conſecrate to their Idol the firſt Bit and Draught of their Meat and Drink. But, I believe this black God they rail againſt is the Devil, whom their cunning Prieſts repreſent to that ignorant People in ſome black and ugly Shape, ſometimes of a black Dog. If they paint themſelves with Chalk, they think they do good Service to their God. When he is angry with them they uſe to bribe the Prieſt with Gold; ſo their Fiſhermen are uſe to do when they have no ſucceſs at Sea: the Prieſt with his Wives, walk in Proceſſion, knocking his Breaſts and clapping his Hands, then hanging ſome Boughs from their Necks, and playing on a Timbrel, the Prieſts fling Wheat into the Sea, to appeaſe the angry God. They have certain Trees in great Veneration, conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them as with Oracles, uſing divers fooliſh Ceremonies. They worſhip a certain Bird which hath Feathers like Stars, and a voice like a Bull. The <hi>Tunny</hi> is a ſacred Fiſh with them, and not to be touched; ſo are the Mountains, whoſe Tops they daily feed, or the Prieſts rather, with Meat and Drink, When one dieth the Prieſt makes Gods of Straw to accompany the Dead into the other World; Wine and good Chear are ſent with him, and Servants with his Wives: if he be the King, theſe are ſlain to wait upon the King, and their Heads advanced upon Poles round about the Grave. They hold it a Sin to ſpit on the Ground. The Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is their Sabbath. They uſe Circumciſion, and ſome other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. The <hi>Goths</hi> believed, That the Dead went into a pleaſant place, where their God <hi>Tamolxines</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: to him they uſed ſtill to ſend a Meſſenger, choſen out among themſelves by Lot, who in a Boat of five Oars went to ſupplicate for ſuch things as they wanted. Their manner of ſending him was thus; They took him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46445:16"/>Hand and Foot and flung him upon the points of ſharp Pikes; if he fell down, they concluded that the God was well pleaſed with that Meſſenger; if otherwiſe, they rejected him as an unworthy Envoy: therefore they choſe another, to whom they gave Inſtructions, before he died, what he ſhould ſay to their God; and ſo having ſlain him upon their Pikes, committed the dead Body in the Boat to the mercy of the Sea. The <hi>Lithuanians</hi> uſed to burn their chief Captives to their Gods. The <hi>Luſitanians</hi> ripped open the Bowels of their Captives in their Divinations, and preſented their right hands, being cut off, to their Gods. The <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonians</hi> worſhipped an Idol called <hi>Suantovitus,</hi> whoſe Prieſt, the day before he ſacrificeth, makes clean the Chappel, which none muſt enter but he alone; and whilſt he is in it he muſt not draw his Breath, but hold his Head out of the Window, leſt with his mortal Breath he ſhould pollute the Idol. The next day, the People watching without the Chappel door, view the Idol's Cup; if they find any of the Liquor which was put there waſted, they conclude the next years Scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but otherwiſe they hope for Plenty; and ſo they fill the Cup again, and pray to the Idol for Victory and Plenty: then pouring out old Wine at the Idol's Feet, and offering to him a great Cake, they ſpend the reſt of the day in gormondizing: it is held a ſin and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Idol, not to be drunk then. Every one payeth a piece of Money to the Idol's maintenance; to which alſo is paid the third part of all Booties taken in the War. To this purpoſe the Idol maintaineth three hundred Horſe, whom the Prieſt paid, being the Idol's Treaſurer. In <hi>Lithuania, Ruſſia,</hi> and the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent places, the Ruſticks offer a yearly Sacrifice of Calves, Hogs, Sows, Cocks, and Hens, about the end of <hi>October,</hi> when their Fruits are all gathered in, to their Idol <hi>Ziemiennick:</hi> they beat all theſe Creatures to death, then offer them with Prayers and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; which done, they fall to eating and drinking,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46445:17"/>flinging firſt pieces of Fleſh into every Corner of the Houſe.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. The ancient <hi>Brittains</hi> worſhipped <hi>Mercury</hi> in the firſt place, as being the God of High-ways, Journeys, Gain, and Merchandizing. After him they worſhipped <hi>Apollo, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Minerva.</hi> They and the <hi>Germans</hi> were wont to ſacrifice Men ſometimes, ſo did the ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> which with the <hi>Gauls</hi> had the ſame Religion and Prieſts, called <hi>Druides,</hi> from the Oaks, under which they uſed to teach and ſacrifice; for, they expounded all Religious Myſteries, taught the Youth, decided Controverſies and Suits in Law, ordained Rewards and Puniſhments; and ſuch as obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their Decrees they excommunicated, debarring them from all Divine Exerciſes, and all Commerce with Men. Theſe <hi>Druides</hi> had one chief over them, whoſe Succeſſor was always elected: they were free from paying Taxes, from ſerving in the Wars, and had many other Priviledges. They committed not the myſteries of their Religion to Writing, but to the Memory of their Diſciples, who ſpent many years in learning by heart their Precepts in Verſe. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Immortality of Souls, they read Philoſophy to their Scholars. It is thought by ſome, that <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple ſtood where St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London</hi> ſtands now; and <hi>Minerva</hi> had her Temple at <hi>Bath;</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> near <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> worſhipped the ſeven Planets, among which, <hi>Thor,</hi> the ſame with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was chief; from him <hi>Thurſday</hi> was denominated. Next was <hi>Woden,</hi> or <hi>Mars, Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> is ſo called from him: <hi>Frea,</hi> or <hi>Frico,</hi> was <hi>Venus,</hi> to whom <hi>Friday</hi> was dedicated, as <hi>Tueſday</hi> to <hi>Tuiſco</hi> the Founder of the <hi>German</hi> Nation: but the <hi>Germans</hi> at firſt had neither Images nor Temples, but abroad worſhipped the Sun, Moon, and Stars. Mother <hi>Earth</hi> was in chief Eſteem among them; to her they dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a Chariot in a Grove, which was lawful only for the Prieſt to touch. He was never to leave the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46445:17"/>which was always covered with Cloth, and was drawn by two Oxen in Proceſſion: then Holy-Days were appointed; at the end of her Journey, ſhe, with the Chariot and Cloth, were waſhed in a certain Lake; but the Miniſters who performed this Work, were never ſeen any more, but were ſwallowed by the Lake, and the Goddeſs reſtored again by her Prieſt to her Grove.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. The old <hi>Saracens</hi> worſhipped the Sun under the ſhape of a half naked Man ſet upon a Pillar, whoſe Head and Face was all beſet with fiery Rayes, holding on his Breaſt a flaming Wheel, by which they ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sun's Heat, Light, and Motion. They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Moon under the form of a Woman, with a ſhort Coat, and a Hood with long Ears, with the Picture of the Moon before her Breaſt; they gave her alſo piked Shoos: the reaſon whereof might poſſibly be this, if I may have leave to conjecture; They gave her a ſhort Coat to ſhew the ſwiftneſs of her Motion, for a long Coat ſignifieth a ſlow Motion; therefore they painted <hi>Saturn,</hi> whoſe motion is the ſloweſt of all the Planets, with a long Coat. The Hood or Chapron with long Ears, was to repreſent her Horns, or elſe to ſhew that Sounds are heard afar off in the Night, which is the time of her Dominion. Her piked Shoos may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſemble her Horns. But now having gone through all the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of all Nations of the World, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern, it is now high time to give ſome account of Chriſtianity and it's Diviſion into ſeveral Schiſms, Sects, and Superſtitions.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. Chriſtianity, which is the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, delivered to Man by <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> the Son of God, who aſſuming our Nature of a pure Virgin, taught the <hi>Jews</hi> the true way to Happineſs, confirming his Doctrine by Signs and Miracles, at length ſealed it with his Blood; and ſo having ſuffered Death for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, he aſcended to his Father, leaving twelve Apoſtles behind him to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46445:18"/>propagate this Doctrine through the World, which they did accordingly, confirming their Words with Miracles and their own Blood; and ſo this Light of the Goſpel ſcattered all the Fogs and Miſts of Gentile Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, at the ſight of this Ark of the new Covenant, the Dagon of Idolatry fell to the ground. When this Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> did roar, all the Beaſts of the Forreſt, that is, the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols, or Devil rather, hid themſelves in their Dens. <hi>Apollo</hi> complained that his Oracles failed him, and that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Child had ſtopped his Mouth. When it was proclaimed at <hi>Palotci</hi> by <hi>Thanas</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Ship-Maſter, that the great God <hi>Pan</hi> was dead, all the Evil Spirits were heard to howl and bewail the Overthrow of their Kingdom. <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> complained, that the Preaching of <hi>Christ</hi> had weakned the Power of their Gods, and hindred the Gain of their Prieſts. The Bones of <hi>Babylas</hi> ſo hindred <hi>Apollo,</hi> that he could deliver no Oracle while they were there. The <hi>Delphick</hi> Temple fell down with Earth-quake and Thunder when <hi>Julian</hi> ſent to conſult with the Oracle. Such was the irreſiſtable Power of the two-edged Sword which came out of Chriſt's Mouth, that nothing was able to withſtand it. The little Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands, ſmote the great Image of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and brake it in pieces. To the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of twelve poor Fiſher-men did the great Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the World ſubmit their Scepters. Thus the Stone which the Builders refuſed became the head of the Corner. The terrible Beaſt, which with his iron Teeth deſtroyed all the other Beaſts, is deſtroyed by the weakneſs of preaching; againſt which, the more the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſtrugled the more it was foiled, and found by Experience, that the blood of Martyrs was the Seed of the Church, which conquered the great Conquerours, not with acting, but with ſuffering; not by the Sword but by the Word; and more by their Death than by their Life: like ſo many <hi>Sampſons</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over theſe <hi>Philiſtines</hi> in their Death and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46445:18"/>But long did it not continue in it's Splendour and Purity: Hereſie and Perſecution did quickly break in upon it. Perſecution firſt beginning under <hi>Nero,</hi> and continued with all the Barbarity imaginable under his Succeſſors: but Hereſie broke forth much ſooner, and made way for <hi>Mahumetaniſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. The firſt Heretick was <hi>Simon,</hi> called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> becauſe he was a Witch; a <hi>Samaritan</hi> by Birth, and a Chriſtian by Profeſſion; he would have bought the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt for Money, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46445:24"/>That he kept Conventicles in the Night with filthy Women, and that he uſed to pray amongſt them.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Trinity they acknowledge only three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct degrees of Power in God; the greateſt is the Father, the leſſer is the Son, and the leaſt of all the Holy Ghoſt.

They held it unlawful for Men or Women to wear Cloaths in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Aſſemblies, ſeeing their Meetings were the only Paradiſe on Earth, where they were to have Life Eternal, and not in Heaven; as <hi>Adam</hi> then in his Paradiſe, ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in theirs ſhould be naked, and

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46445:25"/>teaching that God required nothing from us but a good Life. Of theſe we have too many in this Age. But Chriſt tells us, that Life Eternal conſiſts in Knowledge; and God complaineth by the Prophet, that his People periſh for want of Knowledge: So Chriſt ſheweth, that Deſtruction fell on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe ſhe knew not her day; and the Lord complained, that his People had leſs Knowledge than the Oxe or the Aſs: therefore God hath given Lips to the Prieſt to preſerve Knowledge; and Chriſt, by his own Knowledge, hath juſtified many, ſaith the Prophet. The <hi>Armenii</hi> taught that the Holy Ghoſt proceeded only from the Father, and not from the Son: that Chriſt roſe from the dead on the Sabbath day, whereas the Scripture tells us plainly, that he aroſe the third day. They obſerved alſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices: they uſed firſt to baptize the Croſs, then to worſhip it: they taught, it was not Man that ſinned, but <hi>Satan,</hi> by tempting him; and, that Man had not propagated by carual Copulation if he had not ſinned They denyed Original Sin, and held, that all who dyed before Chriſt were damned for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin: they aſcribed no Efficacy to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet held Baptiſm abſolutely neceſſary: they placed the Children of unbaptized Infants, if they were of faithful Parents, in earthly Paradiſe; if of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in Hell: they never baptized without adminiſtring the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> they held Baptiſm without Criſm inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: they uſed Rebaptization: they permitted the Husband to diſſolve Matrimony when he pleaſed, and denyed Prayers for the Dead, and the Eternity of Hell Fire; and that the Souls were not in Bliſs till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and taught, that then there ſhould be no Women at all, but that they ſhould be converted into Men. <hi>Chazinzarii</hi> were ſo called from <hi>Chazus,</hi> which in their Language ſignifieth the Croſs: for, they taught that the Croſs was only to be worſhipped; therefore they were named Croſs-Worſhippers: they profeſſed all <hi>Neſtorianiſm.</hi> The <hi>Thnetopſychitae</hi> held, that the

               <p>SOME Men have brave Names, but mean Actions; ſome brave Actions and mean Names; and ſome both brave Names and Actions. In the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Mahomet</hi> may not be unfitly reckoned, who in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Name was ſecond to none, and yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of Manners had few Equals: for, we are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the learned in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language, that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> comes of a Word ſignifying Praiſe and Honour, and that this Notation of his Name was but a Preſage of his future Actions, whereby he merited and purchaſed both. Others ſay, <hi>Mahomet</hi> imports Thankſgiving; which is to be underſtood with reſpect to their Duty of Gratitude, who believe he procured great Benefits for them. And that there might want nothing of lucky Abodement in the Name of this great Impoſtor, ſome of his flattering Doctors paraphraſe it by a Man of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. But, be his name what it will, we ſhall proceed to give an account of the Life of this Impoſtor, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we find it written by the <hi>Saracens</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Book of the Generation of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God, (the Prayer and Salvation of God be upon him) from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to the time when God brought him forth gracious, perfect, and fit for himſelf. When as <hi>Rabachbar</hi> had learned out of the Scriptures, and by Aſtrology, that this Prophet ſhould be born to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46445:26"/>the World, he heard that there was a Man born in <hi>Jeſeras,</hi> a City of <hi>Arabia,</hi> having all ſuch Marks and Tokens as he had fore-ſeen by the Propheſies and his Arts; <hi>viz.</hi> a ſpot on his Fore-head, a print between his Shoulders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to ſatisfie his deſire, he went thither to ſee; where finding thoſe Tokens fulfilled in young <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he thereupon expounded the dark Myſtery of his far-fetch'd Light, learned of his Maſter <hi>Kabelmedi,</hi> in this manner: When <hi>Adam</hi> was newly created, as he ſtood up his Brain ſhaked, and made a Noiſe, as the Leaves do which are ſhaken with the Wind; whereat <hi>Adam</hi> wondring, God ſaid unto him, The ſound which thou haſt heard is the ſign of the Prophets and Meſſengers of my Commandments; take heed therefore that thou commit this Seed of Light only to worthy Loyns, and to a clean Womb: and this Light of <hi>Mahomet</hi> that ſhould be born, ſhined from the face of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Sun, or Moon at the full. And when he had begotten <hi>Seth,</hi> that Light paſſed inſtantly from the Face of <hi>Adam</hi> into the Face of <hi>Eve,</hi> inſomuch that the Birds of the Air, and Beaſts of the Earth, wondred at her Beauty: yea, the Angels every day ſaluted her, and brought her Odours out of Paradiſe, till ſhe brought forth <hi>Seth</hi> alone, having before at every Burthen brought forth a Brother and a Siſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seth</hi> inherited this Light, which remained between Heaven and Earth, the Angels thereby aſcending and deſcending upon <hi>Seth,</hi> and crying always, <q>Rejoyce thou Earth, worthy of the Light of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> on him be Prayer and Salvation of God.</q> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> drawing near to his end, declared unto him, by his Teſtament, the Myſteries of that Light, and the Genealogy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Then deſcended <hi>Gabriel,</hi> accompanied with three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten thouſand Angels, bearing every one of them a white Leaf and a Pen, which ſigned the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Continuance of the Order of the prophetical Generation. <hi>Seth</hi> received this Writing, and was cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a double red Garment, ſhining as the Sun, as ſoft as the Violet Flower.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:46445:26"/>
               <p>From him it paſſed by Succeſſion to <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Sem;</hi> then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> at whoſe Birth two Lights from the Eaſt and Weſt (meeting in the midſt) lightned the whole World; and the Angels were heard ſinging, that it was the light of the Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſhould be born of his Seed, whoſe Words ſhould be the virtue of God. This Light paſſed from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the face of <hi>Hagar,</hi> being with Child, and after to <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> and God told him, that the Soul of <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the beginning of the Creation, was mingled with his, and that his name in Heaven ſhould be <hi>Aſmet,</hi> in Earth <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and in Paradiſe <hi>Abvaltrazim.</hi> At this <hi>Sarah</hi> grieved, untill three Angels comforted her with the Promiſe of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> From <hi>Iſhmael</hi> it removed to <hi>Keydar</hi> his Son, who being endued with ſeven Gifts, marryed <hi>Nulta</hi> of the Land of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> but being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Oracle, he took to Wife <hi>Algadira,</hi> an <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and after, by divine warning, carried the Cheſt of this Light unto <hi>Jacob.</hi> Then was <hi>Hamel</hi> born to him, and received the ſame Light; in which, ſucceeded <hi>Thebickt, Hamieſſa, Adoth, Adure, Adne, Machat, Nizar, Muſar, Aliez, Madraca, Hoocima, Knieva, Anofro, Melic, Falhrem, Luic, Galiben, Kab, Murran, Cudai, Abdamenef, Heſim,</hi> a man by divine Teſtimony free of all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To him did all Kings offer their Daughters in Marriage, and amongſt the reſt <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which he refuſed, and married <hi>Selina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Geit,</hi> and had by her <hi>Abdalmutalib,</hi> whoſe Light cauſed Rain in the Drought. To him an Elephant proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid with Man's Voice, Selvation be on you, and on the Light that ſhineth out of your Reins. Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Fame, Honour, and Victory, be on you, and that there ſhould proceed from him a King greater than all the Kings of the Earth. Another time, as he ſlept on the Stone which was placed by <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his Oratory at <hi>Mecca,</hi> he dreamed of a Chain reaching Eaſt and Weſt, and to Heaven, and to the Depth, which was preſently converted into a flouriſhing Herb. <hi>Noe</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> preſented themſelves Interpreters of this dream.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46445:27"/>
                  <hi>Abdalla</hi>'s Son, the Father of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> had a Tutor given unto him to defend him from his Enemies, who ſeemed a Man, but was none. He was preſerved from the lying in wait of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by threeſcore and ten Angels, which ſeemed men. He wedded <hi>Hermina,</hi> and therefore two hundred Women periſhed for his love, ſome hanging, ſome burning themſelves.</p>
               <p>When the preſcribed time was come, in the Month <hi>Dulheia,</hi> on a Friday night, God bad <hi>Ariduran</hi> to open the Gates of Paradice, that the innermoſt of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets might be manifeſted: for it pleaſeth me, ſaid he, this night to tranſport the Light of my Prophet from the Reins of <hi>Abdalla</hi> into the Womb of <hi>Hermina,</hi> and that it come into the World. This being done, as <hi>Abdalla,</hi> the Judge and Lord of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe of Prayer, he perceived a great Light to lighten from his Houſe up towards Heaven, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently died. On the twelfth day of <hi>Rab,</hi> on a Tueſday <hi>Mahomet</hi> was circumciſed, and all frolick. And then all Idols fell, and became black; all Kingdoms were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and not one ſtood upright. <hi>Lucifer</hi> was caſt into the bottom of the Sea, and in forty days could not get out, and then called his Fellows, and told them, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born with the power of the Sword, who ſhould take away all their Power. The ſame alſo God cauſed to be proclaimed in Heaven and Earth. His Mother ſaid, that ſhe was delivered of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain; and Angelical Birds came to nouriſh the Child, and a man clothed in white preſented him with three Keys, like to Pearls, which he took; the Key of Victory, they Key of the Laws, and the Key of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And after came three Perſons with ſhining Faces, preſenting him with a Caldron of Emeralds, with four handles, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> accepted as a ſign of his Rule over all the World. The Birds, Clouds, Winds, Angels, contended, for the nouriſhment of the Child. But the caſe was determined by Heavenly Voice, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould not be taken from the hands of men.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46445:27"/>An Aſs almoſt famiſhed worſhipped him, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him on her back, became Herald to this new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, with man's voice proclaiming the worthineſs of her Carriage. Three men carried him up into a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: of which, one opened him from the Breaſt unto the Navil, and waſhed his Entrails with Snow: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cleared his Heart in the midſt, and took out of it a black grain, ſaying, that it was the portion of the Devil. The third made him whole again. <hi>Seraphin</hi> nouriſhed him three years, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> nine and twenty, who gave unto him, in the fortieth year of his age, the Law, and carried him to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, <hi>Gabriel,</hi> with threeſcore and ten pair of Wings, came to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in the Chamber of <hi>Aiſſa,</hi> his beſt beloved Wife, and ſaid, that God would have him to viſit him where he is, and brought with him the Beaſt <hi>Elmparac,</hi> or <hi>Albarach</hi> of nature between a Mule and an Aſs. This Beaſt told <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he would not take him on his back until he had prayed God for him. His ſteps were as far as one could ſee, ſo that in the twinkling of an Eye, he had brought <hi>Mahomet</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Then <hi>Gabriel</hi> with his Girdle tied the Beaſt to a Rock, and carried <hi>Mahomet</hi> on his ſhoulders into Heaven, where he knocked, and the Porter opened. Here <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaw footſteps of Angels, and prayed twice on his knees for them: and amongſt the reſt, old Father <hi>Adam,</hi> rejoycing for ſuch a Son, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him to his Prayers. Then he brought him to the ſecond Heaven, which was a Journey of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; and ſo forth on to the ſeventh Heaven: Here he ſaw the Angelical People, every one of which was a thouſand times greater than the World, and every of them had threeſcore and ten thouſand Heads, and every Head threeſcore and ten thouſand Mouthes, and every Mouth ſeventeen hundred Tongues, praying to God in ſeven hundred thouſand Languages. And he ſaw one Angel weeping, and he asked the cauſe, who anſwered, that he was Sin: and <hi>Mahomet</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:46445:28"/>prayed for him. Then <hi>Gabriel</hi> commended him to another Angel, and he to another, and ſo forth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till he came before God and his Throne. Then God, whoſe Face was covered with threeſcore and ten thouſand Cloaths of Light, and from whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſtood two ſtones caſt below, touched him with his Hand, the Coldneſs whereof pierced to the Marrow of of his Back-bone; and God ſaid, I have impoſed on thee and on thy People, Prayers. When he was returned as far as the fourth Heaven, <hi>Moſes</hi> counſelled him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back, to obtain eaſe unto the People, which could not bear ſo many Prayers; which he did oftentimes, till there remained but few. Thus returning to his <hi>Elmparac,</hi> he rode back to his Houſe at <hi>Mecca:</hi> all this was done in the tenth part of the Night. But when he was requeſted to do thus much in the Peoples ſight, he anſwered, <hi>Praiſed be God, I am a Man, and an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Book <hi>Aſcar</hi> telleth further, that in this Journey <hi>Mahomet</hi> heard a Womans Voice, crying, <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet,</hi> but he held his Peace: Afterwards another called him, but he gave no Anſwer, <hi>Mahomet</hi> asked the Angel who they were? He anſwered, that the one was ſhe which publiſhed the Jews Law, and if he had anſwered her, all his Diſciples ſhould have been Jews; the other was ſhe which delivered the Goſpel, whom if he had anſwered, all his Followers had been Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

Poſſeſſed of all his Maſter's Wealth, he affected eaſe, and being till then of no Religion, or at beſt, a Pagan, he began to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>Sergius,</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Monk, who flying out of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> for fear of puniſhment, (the Hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> being newly both revived and cenſured) came into <hi>Arabia,</hi> where he found entertainment in the Houſe of <hi>Abdalmutalif,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> By his perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, finding him a fit Inſtrument for the Devil to work on, he began to entertain the thoughts of ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering out a new Religion, which might unite all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in ſome common Principles, and bring the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (into which the World was then divided) under one Profeſſion. Reſolved upon this, he retired himſelf into a Cave not far from <hi>Mecca,</hi> as if he there attended nothing but Meditation; <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> in the mean time ſounding in the Ears of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both his Parts and Piety. The People being thus prepared to behold the Pageant, out comes the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actor with ſome parts of his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (pleaſing enough to ſenſual minds) which he profeſſed to have received from the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> And finding that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46445:30"/>this edified to his expectation, he next proclaimed Liberty to all Slaves and Servants, as a thing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him by God, by whom the Natural Liberty of Mankind was moſt dearly tendered; which drew unto him ſuch a Rabble of unruly People, that without fear or oppoſition he diſperſed his Doctrines, reducing them at laſt to a Book or Method.</p>
               <p>The Book of this Religion he called the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that is to ſay, the Collection of Precepts; the Original whereof they feign to be written on a Table which is kept in Heaven, and the Copy of it brought to <hi>Mahomet</hi> by the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> A Book ſo highly reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that they write upon the Cover of it, <hi>Let none touch this but he that is clean.</hi> The Body of it (as it now ſtandeth) was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Oſman,</hi> the fourth <hi>Caliph,</hi> who ſeeing the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> daily inclining to divers Hereſies, by reaſon of ſome falſe Copies of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Law, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by the ſame means was likely to fall into Civil Diſſention; by the help of his Wife, who was <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s Daughter, he got a ſight of all <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Papers, which he reduced unto four Volumes, and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one hundred twenty and four Chapters; command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly upon pain of death, that that Book, and that only, ſhould be received as Canonical through his Dominions. The whole Body of it is but an Expoſition and Gloſs on the eight Commandments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Every one ought to believe that God is a great God, and one only God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> They hold <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the Friend of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Meſſenger of God, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Breath of God; whom they deny to be conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, affirming that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> grew with Child of him by ſmelling to a Roſe, and was deliver'd of him at her Breaſts. They deny the Myſtery of the Trinity, but puniſh ſuch as ſpeak againſt Chriſt: whoſe Religion was not (ſay they) taken away, but mended by <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And he who in his Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> doth not, coming or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46445:31"/>going, viſit the Sepulchre of Chriſt, is reputed not to have merited, or better'd himſelf any thing by his Journey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Every one muſt marry, to increaſe the Sectaries of</hi> Mahomet. Four Wives he alloweth to every man, and as many Concubines as he will, between whom the Husband ſetteth no difference, either in Affection or Apparel, but that his Wives only can enjoy his Sabbath's benevolence. The Women are not admitted in the time of their Lives to come into their Churches, nor after Death, to Paradice: And whereas in moſt, or all other Countreys, Fathers give ſome Portions with their Daughters, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> give Money for their Wives; which being once paid, the Contract is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the <hi>Cadies</hi> Book, and this is all their formality of Marriage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Every one muſt give of his Wealth to the Poor.</hi> Hence you ſhall have ſome buy Slaves, and then manumit them; buy Birds, and then let them flye. They uſe commonly to free Priſoners, releaſe Bond-ſlaves, build Caves or Lodgings in the wayes for the Relief of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, repair Bridges, and mend High-wayes. But their moſt ordinary Alms conſiſt in Sacrifices of Sheep or Oxen, which, when the Solemnity is performed, they diſtribute among the Poor, to whom alſo, on the firſt day of every Year, they are bound to give the tythe, or tenth part of their Gettings in the year fore-going; inſomuch that you ſhall hardly find any Beggars amongſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Every one muſt make his Prayers five times a day.</hi> When they pray, they turn their Bodies toward <hi>Mecca,</hi> but their Faces ſometimes one way, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, believing that <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhall come behind them, being at their Devotions. The firſt time is an hour before Sun-riſing; the ſecond, at Noon-day; the third, at three of the clock in the Afternoon; the fourth, at Sun-ſetting; the fifth and laſt before they go to ſleep. At all theſe times the Cryers kept a bawling in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46445:31"/>Steeples (for the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens</hi> have no Bells) for the People to come to Church. And ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, muſt when they hear the voice of the Cryers, fall down in the place where they are, do their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and kiſs the Ground thrice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Every one muſt keep a Lent one Month in the year.</hi> This Lent is called <hi>Ramazan,</hi> in which they ſuppoſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was given to <hi>Mahomer</hi> by the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi> This Faſt is only intended in the Bay-time, the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leave to frolick in the Night, as they beſt pleaſe, for they abſtaine from Wine and Swines-Fleſh, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in their Law at all times, but never ſo punctually abſtained from as in the time of their Lent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Be Obedient to thy Parents.</hi> Which Law is the moſt neglected of any in all the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> never any Children being ſo unnatural as the <hi>Turkiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill.</hi> And this they heep inviolated among themſelves, but the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are ſare to feel the Smart of their Fury: And, as if by this Law the actual ſhedding of Blood only were prohibited, they have invented Puniſhments for their Offenders worſe than Death it ſelf. As firſt, the <hi>Strappado,</hi> which is hanging of them by the Arms drawn backwards: when they are ſo bound, they are drawn up on high, and let down again with a violent ſwing, which unjoynteth all their Back and Arms. Secondly, they uſe to hoiſe up their Heels, and with a great Cudgel to give them three or four hundred blows on the Soles of their Feet. Thirdly, it is ordinary to draw them naked up to the top of a Gibbet or Tower, full of Hooks, and cutting the Rope to let them fall down again; and by the way they are caught by force of the Hooks, where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hang till they die for Hunger.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Do unto others as thou would'ſt be done unto thyſelf.</hi> To thoſe that keep theſe Laws he promiſeth Paradiſe, a place of all Delights, adorned with Flowry Fields, water'd with Chryſtalline Rivers, beautified with Trees of Gold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe cool ſhade they ſhall ſpend their time with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46445:32"/>Amorous Virgins, whoſe Manſions ſhall not be far diſtant. The Man ſhall never exceed the Age of thirty, nor the Woman of fifteen; and thoſe to have their Virginity renewed, as faſt as loſt.</p>
               <p>Friday He ordained to be the Sabbath, partly to diſtinguiſh his followers from the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſolemnize the days enſuing; but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was on that day proclaimed King or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſolemnly ſo created. Wine and Swines-fleſh are the principal things forbidden by the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> from the laſt whereof they all unanimouſly refrain; but on the firſt they are ſo ſotted, that when they come at it they ſeldom go home again unled: Inſomuch that all the Wines in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have been thrown about the Streets, and Death made the Penalty for any that will preſume to bring any more into the City. <hi>Mahomet</hi> taught them, that every one ſhould be ſaved by his own Religion, him only excepted, that revolted from the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to another Law but ſo, that under the Notion of Religion, he means only ſuch as Worſhip the one and only God, excluding by that means the Old Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Gentiles from the hopes of Salvation. And he taught too, that at the end of the World, all men that profeſſed any ſuch Religion, ſhould go into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Banner of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> under the Banner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Saracens</hi> under the Banner of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They compell no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to abjure the Faith to which he was Born, but commend and approve ſecretly ſuch as they find Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Conſtant in their own Religion; yet holding it an eſpecial Honour to have daily new <hi>Proſolytes;</hi> they incite them by hope of Freedom and Preferment, which with many are motives too much prevailing. Hence I have heard many ſay, that it is better for a man that would injoy liberty of Conſcience, to live in the Countreys profeſſing Mahometaniſm than Papiſtry: for in the one he ſhall never be free from the Bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; in the other he is never moleſted, if he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46445:32"/>meddle not with their Law, their Wives, or their Slaves.</p>
               <p>The Opinions which they hold concerning the end of the World, are very ridiculous; as, That at the winding of a Horn, not all Fleſh only, but the Angels themſelves ſhall die; that the Earth with an Earthquake ſhall be kneaded together like a lump of Dough; that a ſecond blaſt of the ſame Horn ſhall after forty days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all again; that <hi>Cain</hi> ſhall be the Captain or Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Damned, who ſhall have the Countenance of Dogs and Swine; that they ſhall paſs over the Bridge of Juſtice, laden with their Sins in Satchels, that the greater Sinners ſhall fall into Hell, the leſſer into Purgatory only; with a thouſand the like Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which is needleſs to add here, conſidering that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf is now extant in Engliſh, and every one that liſts may read it. A thing ſo full of Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, incoherencies, and ſuch groſs abſurdities, of ſo impure and carnal mixture, that he muſt lay aſide the uſe of his natural Reaſon who is taken by it, if Force, Ambition, or want of a Chriſtian Education do not lead him on. For if we ſeriouſly look into the cauſes of the deplorable exerciſe and long continuance of this Religion, we ſhall find them to be chiefly theſe. 1. The greatneſs of the Victories gotten by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who eaſily compelled the conquered Nations to receive their Law. 2. The great zeal and diligence of the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> themſelves, who being a numerous People, and much given to Merchandize, have poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Africk,</hi> from the Streights o <hi>Babel-mandel,</hi> almoſt as far as to the Cape of <hi>Good Hope;</hi> of all the Iſlands in thoſe Seas, and many Facto ries and good Towns on the Coaſts of <hi>India:</hi> In al which they have ſetled their Religion alſo, as a thing inſeparable from their Nation, 3. A peremptory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of all Diſputation in any point of Religion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be. 4. The ſuppreſſing of Philoſophy, and the ſtudy of Humane Sciences; the light whereof, might
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46445:33"/>eaſily detect the groſſneſs of their Superſtitions. 5. The ſenſual Liberty allowed of having variety of Wives, and as many Concubines as they are able to keep. 6. The promiſe of the like ſenſual Pleaſures in the other World; with which, a Senſe not illuminated with the Spirit of God, doth for the moſt part uſe to be more affected than with the ſpeculative hope of Spiritual Happineſs. 7. The forbidding of Printing and printed Books, by which the People might come to ſee the Verity and Purity of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith; the Falſhood and Impurity of the Law of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> the laſt not uſeful, or at leaſt not able to induce Belief, if the firſt had not opened and prepared the way.</p>
               <p>For indeed, force of Arms was the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf confirms, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in their times have ſince propagated and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Doctrine. Strengthned by the Reſorts of that raſcal Rabble, which repaired to him, he aſſaults <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> pretending a Quarrel to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had there a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> repulſed at firſt with loſs of men, and a wound in his Face, by which ſome of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth were beaten out; there likely to have made an end of his new Religion, if not recovered by his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for a farther Miſchief. At the next Onſet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the Battel being fought near a place called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez,</hi> ſcituate betwixt <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> frequently mentioned in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> After which Fight, he took the City, converting the Synagogue to a Temple, for his own Impieties: the News whereof ſo ſtartled the <hi>Phylarchice,</hi> or Nobility of <hi>Mecca,</hi> that they arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Powers againſt him, and ſped ſo well in the beginning of the War, that they drove him forcibly from their Territories, which not long after he ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſet his chief Seat at <hi>Mecca.</hi> From that his Flight the <hi>Saracens</hi> began their Computation of Years, (as we from Chriſt's Nativity) which they call the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gira,</hi> which beginneth about the Year of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 617. Concerning which time, I cannot but obſerve
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46445:33"/>that <hi>Mahomet</hi> compelled devilliſh Doctrine, beginning his Empire; and <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third aſſumed his Antichriſtian Title, beginning his unlimited Supremacy the ſame year.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time, the <hi>Saracens,</hi> revolting from <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clius</hi> the Eaſtern Emperour, joyned themſelves to him. They had long been diſpleaſed with their condition, and now hoped to mend it: Exaſperated by <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> when they ſerved in his Wars againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them when they asked for their Pay, that <hi>he had more ſtore of Steel than Gold;</hi> but then they wanted a fit Head to reſort unto. Now ſerving <hi>Heraclius</hi> in the ſame War, his Officers uſed them in the ſame ill manner. Asking for Pay, the Treaſurer of the Army made them this anſwer, that <hi>there was ſcarce money enough to pay the</hi> Roman <hi>and</hi> Grecian <hi>Souldiers, and muſt thoſe Dogs be ſo importunate for their Wages?</hi> Provoked herewith, and hearing of the ſame of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they took to him; who, much ſtrengthened by them, and the reſt of their Countreymen, ſoon ſubjected the three <hi>Arabias</hi> to him; And having defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Emperour's Forces ſent againſt him, he added ſome Parts of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> and returning to <hi>Mecca,</hi> there died Frantick, in the ſeventieth year of his Age, and twenty third of his Impoſtures; of which he had ſpent thirteen at <hi>Medina,</hi> and the reſt at <hi>Mecca.</hi> His dead Body being kept four dayes, in expectation of a Reſurrection, which he promis'd to perform at the end of three; grown full of ſtench and putrefaction, was convey'd to <hi>Medina,</hi> and there interred: his Succeſſors, out of wicked Policy, keeping up the reputation of that Religion after his deceaſe, which they derided in his life; and called themſelves <hi>Caliphs</hi> and Vicars General to him their Prophet. His Corps doth not hang in the Air by force of Loadſtones drawing up his Iron Coffin or Cheſt, but lieth buried in the ground, as <hi>Ludovicus Vertomannus,</hi> by his own view, hath obſerved.</p>
               <p>But having given an account of this Impoſtor, and his abominable Doctrines, I will ſhew the Ceremonies they uſe in their Pilgrimages to <hi>Mecca.</hi> This Journey is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every year, and it is held ſo neceſſary, that he who doth not once in his Life go this Pilgrimage, ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
<pb facs="tcp:46445:34"/>damn'd; whe reas Paradice and Remiſſion of ſin is procured to them that go it. The Journey is tedious to them of <hi>Greece,</hi> being ſix months Journey, and dangerous, by reaſon of <hi>Arabian</hi> Thieves, Mountains of Sand, with which divers are overwhelmed, and want of Water in thoſe Deſarts. Their chief care is to be reconciled to each other before they go; for if they leave hot behind them all animoſities, their Pilgrimage will do them no good. They begin their Journey from <hi>Caire,</hi> about three Weeks after their <hi>Easter,</hi> being guarded with 200 <hi>Spachi</hi> on Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medaries, and 200 <hi>Janizaries</hi> on Camels, with 8 pieces of Ordnance, and rich Veſtures for the Prophet, and a green Velvet covering wrought with Gold to cover his Tomb, which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> delivers to the Captain of the Pilgrims. The Camels that carry theſe veſtures are covered with cloth of gold, and many ſmall Bells. The night before they go is kept with great feaſting and triumphs. No man may hinder his Wife from this Pilgrimage, and every Servant is made free that goeth it. The Camel that carrieth the Box with the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is covered with cloth of gold and folk, the Box with ſilk only during the Journey, but with Gold and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els at their entring into <hi>Mecca.</hi> Muſicians alſo and Singers encompaſs the Camel, and much vain pomp is uſed. They uſe divers waſhings by the way, where they find water. When they come to <hi>Mecca,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which they fable was miraculouſly built, receiveth a new cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a new Gate; the old veſtment is ſold to Pilgrims, which hath a vertue in it to pardon ſins. But that you may be the better acquainted with the <hi>Moſquita</hi> and Houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you are to know, that in the midſt of the City is the great <hi>Moſquita</hi> built, they ſay, in the time when their Prophet lived. It is four ſquare, every ſquare half a mile, the whole circuit two miles; in manner of a Cloyſter; the Galleries round about are in manner of four Streets, theſe Streets being ſeparated from each other with Pillars, of Marble ſome, and ſome of Lime and Stone. In the midſt of all, ſeparate from the reſt, is the Houſe of <hi>Abraham.</hi> This <hi>Moſquita</hi> hath 99 Gotes, and five Steeples, of which the <hi>Taliſmans</hi> call the People to their Devotion. And the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46445:34"/>Pilgrims which are not provided of Tents reſort hither, Men and Women lying together; their Houſe of Prayer becoming a Den of Thieves. <hi>Barthema</hi> ſaith, that this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is round, like the <hi>Coliſco</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> that at every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is a deſcent of ten or twelve ſteps, on both ſides whereof ſtand Jewellers, who ſell Gems only; within it is valuted, gilded, and odoriferous, beyond what can be ſpoken: for there are four or five hundred men which ſell Powders to preſerve dead Corpſes and other ſweets. It ſeemeth, that ſince his time the Temple and Houſe of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> are altered. This Houſe is four-ſquare, made of ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Stone, twenty Paces high, and forty in circuit, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſide of this Houſe, within a Wall, there is a Stone of a Span long, and half a Span broad; which Stone, they ſay, fell down from Heaven, a voice from Heaven at the ſame fall being heard; That whereſoever this Stone fell, there ſhould be built the Houſe of God, wherein he will hear the Prayers of Sinners. Then was the Stone as white as Snow; but now, through the kiſſes of Sinners, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo black as it is. The Entrance into this Houſe is ſmall and high there are without this Houſe 31 Pillars of Braſs, upon ſquare Stones, ſuſtaining a thred of Copper reaching from one to another; on which are faſtned many burning Lamps: The Founder of theſe was <hi>Solyman.</hi> Being entred into this Houſe through that difficult Paſſage, there ſtands two Pillars of Marble at the entrance; in the midſt are three of Aloes Wood, covered with Tyles of <hi>India,</hi> of a thouſand Colours, which ſerve to underprop the <hi>Terratza</hi> or Roof. It is ſo dark, that they can hardly ſee within for want of Light; nor is it without an evil Smell. Without the Gate, five Paces, is the <hi>Pond Zunzun,</hi> that bleſſed Pond which the Angel thewed to <hi>Agar</hi> for her Son <hi>Iſhmath,</hi> After many idle Ceremonies performed, they go round about <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Houſe ſeven times; then they waſh-themſelves it the Pond <hi>Zunzun:</hi> of this alſo they drink, and pray for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their Sins. After five days abode at <hi>Mecca,</hi> they go to the Hill of Pardons, fifteen miles diſtant, and there they leave all their Sins behind them, after they have heard; Sermon, and prayed, and offered Sacrifices. Upon their
<pb facs="tcp:46445:35"/>Return, they muſt not look back to the Hill, leſt their Sins follow them. From hence they repair to <hi>Medina,</hi> where <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Sepulchre is thought to be; but by the way they run up a certain Hill, which they call the Mount of Health; they run that they may ſweat out all their Sins. Thence they come pure to the Seducers Tomb, which notwithſtanding they may not ſee, being hanged about with a Silk Curtain, which by the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> being fifty in number, to attend on the Tomb, and to light the Lamps, is taken down when the Pilgrims Captain preſenteth the new one; without, each man gives Handkerchiefs, or ſuch like, to touch the Tomb therewith; this they keep as a ſpecial Relique. When they return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Captain preſenteth the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> to kiſs, and then it is laid up again: the Captain is feaſted, and preſented with a Garment, of Cloth of Gold. They uſed to cut in pieces the Camel, whith his Furniture, which carried the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and reſerve theſe pieces for holy Relicks. The <hi>Alcoran</hi> alſo is elevated, that all might ſee and adore it; which done every one with Joy returns to his own home.</p>
               <p>Now, as to the Ceremonies they uſe in their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſicion, they are circumciſed about eight years of Age; the Child is carried on Horſe-back, with a <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipant</hi> on his Head, to the Temple, with a Torch before him on a ſpear deckt with Flowers, which is left with the Prieſt as his Fee, who firſt nipped the end of the Skin of the Child's yard with Pincers, to mortifie it, then with his Siſſers he nimbly cuts it off; preſently a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is laid to eaſe the Pain, and afterwards Salt.

But to return from this ſtinking Tale, to refreſh our ſelves with the like Sweets of this Paradiſe; They believe that there they have the Wives that there they had, and other Concubines, whom, how, when, whereſoever they will. That Wine ſhall be lawful there, though here unlawful; the reaſon whereof <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaid, was, That the Angels, <hi>Arots</hi> and <hi>Merot,</hi> were ſometime ſent to inſtruct and govern the World, forbidding Men Wine, Injuſtice, and Murder. But a Woman having whereof to accuſe her Husband, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to Dinner, and made them drunk.

Thus ſhe mounted up to Heaven; and upon enquiry of the matter, ſhe was made the Morning Star, and they put to their choice, whether they would be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this World or the World to come: they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their Puniſhment in this, are hanged by Chains, with their Head in a Pit of <hi>Babel,</hi> till the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>The day of Judgment ſhall be in this ſort.

               <p>Thus the World ſhall be empty forty Years: Then ſhall God hold the Heaven and Earth in his Fiſt, and ſay, <hi>Where are now the mighty Men, the Kings and Princes of the World?

               <p n="56">LVI. Amongſt whom, ſprung up <hi>Thomas Muntzer;</hi> who boaſted that he had had Communication with God. By his teaching and writing he did publickly affirm, That the Preachers of that time that contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Endeavours to the advancement of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, were not ſent by God, but were mere Scribes, and impertinent Interpreters of the Scriptures: That the Scriptures and the written Word were not the pure Word of God, but only a bare Teſtimony of the true Word: That the true real Word was ſomething that was intrinſecal and heavenly, and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of the Mouth of God, and conſequently, to be learned intrinſecally, and not out of Scriptures,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46445:37"/>or by any humane Suggeſtion: with ſeveral other ſuch like Tenets, which won him ſeveral Sectaries; and ſtuffing his Sermons with moſt ſeditious and better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the Magiſtrate, and pretending to groan for the return of loſt Liberty, and for the inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preſſures of the people under Tyranny, a very great Concourſe of the Dregs of the People repaired to him; inſomuch, that they broke out into open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, forced away a great part of the Nobility, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Towns and Caſtles; to be ſhort, made an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Devaſtation by Fire and Sword. Whereupon, the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſs</hi> fought the Country People with advantage, and prepared for a ſecond Fight the next day; which <hi>Muntzer</hi> having intelligence of, ſaid, by way of Animation to his Followers, What are thoſe Cannon Bullets? I will receive them in my Gloves, and they ſhall not hurt me: whereby the Country People being encouraged, were the next day beaten by the <hi>Landgrave,</hi> five thouſand ſlain, and three hundred ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who had all their Heads cut off: ſo that while they were ambitious of Liberty, they loſt even the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Life it ſelf. But <hi>Muntzer</hi> himſelf made his Eſcape; but though he ſculk'd for ſome time, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length taken, he continued obſtinate, though the <hi>Landgrave</hi> convinced him by Scripture. But being condemned, and laid upon the Rack, while he cryed out aloud, and wept, the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſpoke to him to this purpoſe; Now thou art puniſhed, <hi>Muntzer,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with thy ſelf by what means thou haſt ſeduced and brought ſo many to Deſtruction: whereat <hi>Muntzer</hi> broke out into a great Laughter, ſaying, This is the Judgment of the Country People. But when being brought to his Death, he was thruſt into a cloſe Priſon, 'tis wonderful how faint-hearted he was, and ſtood extreamly troubled in mind, not being able to give any account of his Faith, but as the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> pronounced before him, and which he told him he was to make a Confeſſion of before God. Being ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46445:38"/>with Souldiers, he openly acknowledged his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and withal, addreſſed theſe Words to the Princes that were preſent, Shew Mercy and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ye Princes, leſt hereafter you incur by my Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Puniſhment I now ſuffer.

               <p n="57">LVII. In the Year of our Lord, 1535. upon the Third of <hi>February,</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> in a Street called <hi>Salar</hi> Street, at the Houſe of <hi>John Sifrid,</hi> a Cloath-Worker, who at that time was gone into <hi>Auſtria</hi> about ſome buſineſs, there met ſeven men Anabaptiſts, and five Women of the ſame Perſwaſion, of which Flock, the Bell-weather was <hi>Theodothere</hi> Botcher; who, rap'd into a ſtrange Enthuſiaſm and Extacy, ſtretching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Ground, naked upon his Back, before his Brethren and Siſters, ſeemed to pray unto God with a certain religious Dread and Horror. Having ended his Prayers, he affirmed, That he had beheld God with his Eyes in the exceſſive and ineffable Riches of his Glory; and that he had had Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him both in Heaven and Hell; and that the day of his Judgment was at hand. After which, he ſaid to one of his Companions, Thou art decreed to eternal Damnation, and ſhalt be caſt into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit; at which the other crying out, the Lord God of Mercy have Compaſſion of me, the Prophet ſaid to him, be of good chear, now art thou the Son of God, thy Sins are forgiven thee.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46445:38"/>commanded them to do the like, as being ſuch as muſt be as ſafe as himſelf. He farther affirmed, that the Children of God ought to look upon all things of this World with Contempt and indignation. And ſince Truth, which is moſt glorious in her Nakedneſs, will not admit the Deformity of any Earthly diſguiſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, he affirmed, that they ought in all things to conform themſelves to that example of Truth and Juſtice. A great many hearing theſe things, having quite caſhier'd all ſhame, offered up their ſhirts, ſmocks, and petticoats, and whatſoever ſavoured of Earth, as a burnt-offering unto God. The Miſtris of the Houſe bing awakened by the ſtink which theſe clothes made in burning, and going up into the upper Chambers, ſhe finds this deplorable repreſentation of immodeſty and impudence; but the power and influence of Prophetical integrity brought the Woman to that paſs, that ſhe was drawn in to wallow in the ſame mire of unſhamefacedneſs, whom therefore he adviſed to continue always a conſtant adherer to the unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth. Going out of the Houſe in this poſture, about three of the clock, the other men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men marched barefoot after him, crying out with a horrid Voice, <hi>Woe, woe, woe, the heavy wrath of God, the heavy wrath of God,</hi> &amp;c. In this fanatick Errour did this Hypocondriack Rabble run about the Streets, making ſuch horrid noiſe, that all <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſeem'd to ſhake and tremble at it, as if it had been aſſaulted by a publick Enemy. The Burghers not having the leſt hint of ſuch a ſtrange and unlook'd for accident (for this furious action happen'd in the dead of the night) took up Arms, and getting theſe People (loſt to all ſhame and Modeſty) up to the Palace, clapt them into Priſon. Being ſo diſpoſed of, they would own no thoughts of ſhame or Chaſtity, but would juſtifie their moſt white and naked truth. In the mean time, the Fire being ſmelt, they brake into the Houſe where it was, and wondring at their caſting of their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46445:39"/>Clothes into the Fire, which had ſince reached the Bed, they made a ſhift to quench it. But the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted and mad People, ſuch as deſerved to be ſent to their Kindred the Savages and Heathens, inconvincibly perſiſted in their peſtiferous Opinion, and ſo upon the fifth of <hi>May</hi> the ſame year, they expiated their wicked Impieties with their Death. Ones farewel Saying was, <hi>Praiſe the Lord inceſſantly.</hi> Anothers was, <hi>O God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge thou our Sufferings!</hi> Others cryed out, <hi>Woe, woe, ſhut thine eyes.</hi>

               <p n="58">LVIII. The next we will bring upon the Stage, are <hi>John Reeves</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that they are the two laſt Witneſſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Chriſt, ſent by his Spirit to ſeal the fore-heads of the Elect and Reprobate: that one <hi>John Robins</hi> is the laſt great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and Son of Perdition, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> becauſe he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lying ſigns and wonders, and aſſumes to himſelf the Titles of the only God, in that he calls himſelf <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and Father of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in ſaying the three Perſons in Trinity are <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, Himſelf, <hi>Abel,</hi> that is, the Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> that is the Holy Ghoſt: many ſuch Blaſphemies they aſcribe to him. They affirm alſo, that Chriſtians uſing the Sword of Steel, are ignorant of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and Enemies to his Goſpel; and they teach, that the two uncreated Subſtances of Earth and Water, were eternally reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Preſence of God the Creator; that Death was from Eternity: that the Perſon of the reprobate Angel or Serpent, entred into the Womb of <hi>Eve,</hi> and there died, but quickened in her all manner of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that there is no Devil at all without the Body of Man or Woman, but what dwells within them, ſo that the Devil ſpoken of ſo often in the Scripture, is man's Spirit of unclean Reaſon, and curſed imagination; that God the Father was a Spiritual man from Eternity, and that in time his Spiritual Body brought a Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that if the very God-head had not died, that is,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46445:39"/>ſay they, the Soul of Chriſt, which is the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had not died, all men had periſhed eternally: that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> are Angels, and did repreſent the Perſon of the Father in Heaven, as they did the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son on Earth; that <hi>Eliah</hi> was made Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of God, when God became a Child; and that he filled the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> with thoſe great Revelations of his former Glory which he poſſeſſed in Heaven, when he was the immortal Father; and that it was <hi>Eliah</hi> who ſpake theſe words, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> they ſay alſo, that all the Miniſtry in this World, whether Prophetical or Miniſterial, with all the Worſhip taught by them, is a Lye, and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord. Again, they declare, that whereas <hi>there are three Witneſſes on Earth, Water, Blood, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> that by Water is meant the Commiſſion given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets under the Law; by Blood, the Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, and Miniſters of the Goſpel; and by the Spirit is meant the Commiſſion of the two Witneſſes that were to come in this laſt age, whoſe Miniſtry is inviſible and Spiritual, cutting off all formal worſhipping of an inviſible, ſpiritual, perſonal God: they ſay there is hardly a Miniſter in the World that confeſſeth an inviſible God, but they preach a God of three Perſons, that is a Monſter inſtead of one true Perſonal God: they ſay, that the true God is a diſtinct Body or Perſon, as a Man is a diſtinct Body or Perſon: Again, they ſay that there is no Chriſtian Magiſtrate in the World that hath any Authority from Chriſt to ſet up any inviſible Form of Worſhip; and that the Spirits and Bodies of men are both mortal, both begot together, and both of one nature; that the Spirit is nothing without the Body, and that is the Spirit alone that walks and works, eats and drinks, and dyes, for the Spirit is a natural fire of Reaſon: they ſay alſo, that the Bodies or Perſons of holy men, wherein they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died, ſhall not appear again any more; but when the Saints are glorified, they are abſolutely of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46445:40"/>the very ſame glorious nature, both in Spirit and Body, as God is; and that Believers Spirits are of the very ſame Divine nature of God. This is the Sum of their Divinity and Philoſophy, as may be ſeen in their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Spiritual Treatiſe, as they call it, which is ſull of tranſcendent nonſence and blaſphemies; for here they lay the axe to the very root of Chriſtianity, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a new Father to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in calling the Bleſſed Trinity a Monſter, in denying the Creation, whilſt they make Earth and Water eternal; in making Angels and mens Souls mortal; in making weak man Gods Protector, and Author of that Divine knowledge which was in Chriſt; in denying the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the Power of the Magiſtrates, and the outward Worſhip of God, and making the Souls of men corporeal; in denying alſo the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming men into the Divine nature. By theſe and other wicked Tenets, permitted and countenanced among us at this time, we ſee what Chriſtian Religion is come to in this Land.</p>
               <p n="59">LIX. But before I quit this Theme, it will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſeaſonable, that I give an account of the <hi>Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> who are a ſort of Beaſts who neither divide the hoof, nor chew the cud; that is to ſay, unclean ones, ſuch as hold no ſmall correſpondence with the Quakers; their Lives and demeanours are much alike, only what the Ranters act upon the Stage, by an open profeſſion of lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irreligion, the other do it within the Curtain, by crafty and ſeemingly innocent inſinuations and pretences of Sanctity, and contempt of the things of this World. Theſe are they that make a laughing-ſtock of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, by their bitter invectives and deriſion of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Ceremonies of the Chriſtian Religion; theſe are they that make no diſtinction between <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> for having cryed down the former, their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations will not bear with the latter; it being their main deſign to bring the buſineſs of Religion to that condition wherein Man was before he had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46445:40"/>thoughts of Government; that is to ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anarchy and confuſion. As for their Blaſphemies and horrid expreſſions of Chriſtian things, <hi>Mahumetans, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> own more Modeſty and leſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs. But to retail their Opinions, or to anatomize this Monſter, we muſt come to particulars. 1. They hold, that God, Devils, Angels, Heaven, Hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Fictions and Fables. 2. That <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Baptiſt, and Chriſt are Impoſtors; and what Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acquainted the World with, as to matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, periſhed with them, and nothing tranſmitted to us. 3. That preaching and praying is uſeleſs, and that it is but publick lying. 4. That there is an end of all Miniſtry and Adminiſtrations, and People are to be taught immediately from God. 5. They hold Baptiſm a pure legal Adminiſtration, nor proceeding from Chriſt, but from <hi>John.</hi> 6. They jeſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (that Divine Legacy of our Salvation) out of all Life, Reverence, and Authority, quoting it in driblets and ſhreds, to make it the more ridiculous. In their Letters they endeavour to be ſtrangely prophane and blaſphemous, uttering Atheiſtical Curſes and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which is a kind of canting amongſt them, as among Gipſies; as for example, in one you have this ſtyle, <hi>My own hearts-blood, from whom I daily receive Life and Being, to whom is aſcribed all Honour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art my Garment of Needle-work, my Garment of Salvation. Eternal Plagues conſume you all, not, ſink, and damn your Bodies and Souls into devouring fire, where none but thoſe who walk uprightly can enter. The Lord grant that we may know the worth of Hell, that we may ſcorn Heaven.</hi> 7. Sin is onely what a man imagines and conceives to be ſo within himſelf. 8. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances they account poor low things, nay, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Scriptures are ſo inconſiderable in their apprehenſions, that they pretend to live above them. <hi>Their Lives witneſs without them.</hi> 9. If you ask them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46445:41"/>what Chriſtian Liberty is, they will tell you, that it conſiſts in a Community of all things; and among the reſt, of Women; which they paint over with an expreſſion, called, <hi>The enjoyment of the Fellow Creature.</hi> 10. The enjoyment of the Fellow-Creature cannot but be ſeconded with laſcivious Songs, drinking of Healths, Muſick, Dancing, and Bawdry. Laſtly, They are thoſe who moſt of all kick againſt the Pricks of Authority: for Magiſtracy cannot have any thing more ſacred than the Miniſtry; ſo that they wiſh as much Policy in the State as Government in the Church; which is none at all; ſo to bring an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkneſs upon both, that the Word might be the leſs ſcandalized at their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Extravagancies. But this Age, which is much more faithful in Religions than good Works, of Scripture Phraſes than of Scripture Practices, of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than of Piety, has ſpawned more Religions than that Lady of <hi>Holland</hi> did Infants; to mention all which, were to tire my ſelf and Reader; therefore I ſhall quit ſo nauſeous a Subject, and look back, and give a ſhort account of the ſeveral Sects amongſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> it not being at all neceſſary to ſpeak of it in it's Purity, that matter having been canvaſſed by ſo many others.</p>

Theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were alſo called <hi>Nazarites,</hi> who taught, that with the Goſpel ſhould be joyned the Law of <hi>Moſes, Act.</hi> 15.2.

The <hi>Sampſorans</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one God, and worſhipped him, uſing certain Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Some of them abſtained from living Creatures, and would dye for <hi>Elxai</hi> his Poſterity; which they had in ſuch Honour, that if they went abroad, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would gather up the duſt of their feet for Cures, and their Spittle, and uſed them for Amulets and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives. They admit neither the Apoſtles nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; they worſhip Water, eſteeming it as a God, believing that Life is from thence. The. <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46445:44"/>called from their ſkill in curing Diſeaſes, (for they were much given to the Study of Phyſick) in their Opinions were <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> aſcribing all things to Fate, offering no Sacrifices but of inanimate things, ſhunning Oaths, Pleaſures, and Wine, contenting themſelves with Water only, and mean Apparel; their Garments were white, and they had all things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt them. They worſhipped towards the <hi>East,</hi> obſerved the Sabbath more ſtrictly than others; kept ſeven Pentecoſts every Year, to wit, every ſeventh Week one; and generally they abſtained from Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; yet ſome did marry for Procreation. They were ſuperſtitious in preſerving the Names of Angels; they were much given to Silence, with the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> chiefly at Table: none were admitted into their Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety without four Years Probation. There were ſome of theſe <hi>Eſſenes</hi> contemplative only, and lived in Gardens or remote Villages, who contented themſelves with Bread and Salt; others were active, and gave themſelves to manual Labours: theſe lived in Cities, and fared better, and eat twice a day.</p>

               <head>Of Marriage Ceremonies.</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>Roman</hi> Marriages, which commenced with Contracts, mutually ſealed and ſigned with the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of divers Witneſſes there preſent, there were ſundry Cuſtoms obſerved by them. The Man, in token of good Will, gave to the Woman a Ring, which ſhe was to wear upon the next Finger to the little one of the Left-hand, becauſe unto that finger alone a certain Artery proceedeth from the Heart. The word <hi>Nuptiae</hi> which ſignifieth Marriage, had it's derivation <hi>à nubo,</hi> which in old time ſignify'd to cover; the Cuſtom being, that the Woman ſhould be brought to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a Covering or Veil caſt over her Face. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by cauſe of the good Succeſs that <hi>Romulus</hi> and his Followers had in the violent taking away of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Women, they continued a Cuſtom, that the Man ſhould come and take away his Wife by a ſeeming vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from the Lap or Boſom of her Mother, or her next Kin. She being thus taken away, her Husband did diſſever and divide the Hair of her Head with the top of a Spear, wherewith ſome Fencer had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly killed; which Ceremony did betoken, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould disjoyn them but ſuch a Spear and ſuch like violence. Towards Night the Woman was brought home to her Husband's Houſe with five Torches, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby the need which married Perſons have of five Goddeſſes and Gods, <hi>Jupiter, Juno, Venus, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> who is alſo called <hi>Lucina.</hi> When the Woman was thus brought to the door, then did ſhe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46445:45"/>anoint the Poſts of the Door with Oyl; from which Ceremony the Wife was called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor, quaſi <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nxor.</hi> This ended, the Bride-men did lift her over the Threſhold, and ſo carried her in by a ſeeming violence, becauſe in modeſty ſhe would not ſeem to go without force into that place where ſhe muſt ceaſe to be a Maid. At her carrying in, all the Company did cry out with a loud Voice, <hi>Talaſſio, Talaſſio;</hi> for which Cuſtom <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> alledges this Reaſon for one; At the Rapture of the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins, there were ſome of the poorer ſort ſpied carrying away one of the faireſt Women, ſome of the chief Citizens would have taken her from them, but they began to cry out, That they carried her to <hi>Talaſſius,</hi> a great Man, and well-beloved among the <hi>Romans;</hi> at the naming of <hi>Talaſſius</hi> they ſuffered her to be carried away, themſelves accompanying her, and often crying, <hi>Talaſſio, Talaſſio,</hi> from whence it hath been continued as a Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ever after at their Marriages to ſing <hi>Talaſſio, Talaſſio.</hi>

Now as to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Virgins and Eſpouſals, theſe were made, ſaith <hi>Moſes de Kotſi,</hi> either with Money, or with an Inſtrument, or with Copulation: it ſeemeth, that this laſt is underſtood of ſuch as had lain with a Maid, and therefore muſt by the Law mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, (if the Father denied him not their Daughter;) whereas otherwiſe they might not have carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany before the Marriage was ſolemnized, this being forbidden no leſs than to lye with a Woman in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Their Prayer-Book ſaith thus, He who ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe a Woman bringeth Witneſſes, and before them doth betroth her with Money, or ſomewhat Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, which he giveth her, ſaying, Be thou eſpouſed to me according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> If there be not Witneſſes it is nothing, notwithſtanding they both conſeſs it. If one ſhall affiance a Woman to another, he ſaith, Be thou eſpouſed to <hi>N.</hi> with this Ring, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael. Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfius</hi> writeth, That when Promiſe hath paſſed between
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46445:46"/>two, many <hi>Jews</hi> are called together into a great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where every of the Youths holdeth a Poſt in his Hand: then comes one and reads the Letters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, that <hi>N.</hi> Son of <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>N.</hi> Daughter of <hi>N.</hi> have promiſed Marriage to each other, each giving ſo much in Dowry, which Marriage is to be ſolemnized on ſuch a day, and the Party which faileth in the Promiſes ſhall give fifty <hi>Florens.</hi> This done, they wiſh Joy to each other; and the Jewlings preſently break their earthen Pots, whereby they ſignifie to the Parties Proſperity and Abundance. At parting, every one hath a Cup of Wine given them; eight days after neither Party go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the Houſe, and many Youths come and make merry with the Bridegroom, imitating, they think, <hi>Sampſon:</hi> herein ſome ſay that the Man taketh the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed Bride home to his Houſe, to be Witneſs and Keeper of her Virginity, till the Marriage Solemnity. The day before the Marriage, the Bride muſt waſh and purifie her ſelf in cold Water, and put on white and clean Garments. Their waſhing is performed with great Scrapuloſity, in a common watering, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Ciſterns, or Fountains, which muſt be ſo deep that they muſt ſtand up to the Neck in Water; and if it be muddy in the bottom, they muſt have a ſquare Stone to ſtand on, that their whole Feet may ſtand in clear Water, and that the Water may paſs betwixt their Toes; for the leaſt part not covered with Water would fruſtrate the whole Action: and for this cauſe they lay aſide all their Hair-laces, Neck-laces, and Rings: they dive under the Water, ſo that no part may be free from the ſame: Some Jeweſs muſt ſtand by for witneſs hereof, which is twelve years old and a day at leaſt; and there muſt be certain Women ringing with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what when ſhe goeth in or cometh out of the Water, ſome of them alſo leaping and dancing. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſends the Bride a Wedding Girdle emboſſed with Gold, and ſhe him another with Silver Studs. On the Wedding-day the Bride adorns her ſelf in the beſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46445:46"/>
                  <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Dreſs, with her Marriage attire, and by Women, ſinging their ſweeteſt <hi>Epithalamia,</hi> is conveyed into a Chamber; and there placing her on a fair Seat, braid her Hair into goodly Curles, and put a Veil over her Eyes, (in imitation of <hi>Rebecca</hi>'s Modeſty) ſinging mean while, dancing, and expreſſing the greateſt ſigns of Joy, thinking they therein pleaſe God, as being taught by their Rabbies, that God uſed the like curling, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dancing, when he preſented <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam;</hi> yea, refuſed not to ſerve that new Couple, and with his own hands made the Canopy, under which they were to receive their marriage Bleſſing, the Angels with Pipes and Trumpets making Muſick to lead the Dance. That which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>God built a Woman,</hi> the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud</hi> interpreteth, <hi>He made Curls, and he brought her to</hi> Adam, to wit, with leaping and dancing. When the Marriage Benediction is to be ſolemnized, four Boys bear a Canopy on four Poles into the place appointed, which is ſome Street or Garden abroad in the open Air, the People ſounding their Acclamations, <hi>Bleſſed be he which cometh.</hi> The Bride (being led by others) goeth three times about the Bridegroom, as a Cock go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about a Hen, and that forſooth to fulfill that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, <hi>A Woman ſhall compaſs a Man;</hi> he alſo muſt fetch one Compaſs about her: the People alſo beſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the Bride with Wheat, crying out, Encreaſe and multiply; according to that of the <hi>Pſalmist, He filleth thee with the Fat of Wheat.</hi> In ſome places they mingle Money with the Wheat, which the poor <hi>Jews</hi> gather up. The Bride ſtands on the right hand; <hi>for it is written, Thy Wife ſtandeth on thy right hand;</hi> with her Face alſo to the South, for then ſhe ſhall be fruitful. The <hi>Rabbi</hi> who marrieth them, taketh the end of the Veſtment about the Bride-groom's Neck (they call it <hi>Talles</hi>) and puts it on the Bride's head, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> and then takes a Glaſs filled with Wine, over which he uttereth the Marriage Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, praiſing God, by whoſe inſtinct theſe Perſons were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46445:47"/>eſpouſed, and ſo reacheth the Glaſs to them, and bids them drink. This Glaſs, if ſhe be a Virgin, hath but a narrow Mouth; at <hi>Wormes</hi> they uſe an earthen Pot. Now the <hi>Rabbi</hi> receiving a Ring of pure Gold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Jewel in it, ſheweth it to ſome Witneſſes, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them if it be good, and worth the Money it coſt, and then puts it on the Bride's Finger, and with a loud Voice pronounceth the Spouſal Letters. After this he takes another Glaſs of Wine, and bleſſeth God, that the Bridegroom and Bride have accepted of each other, and gives it them to taſte. This done, the Bridegroom breaketh the former Glaſs againſt the Wall or Ground, in remembrance of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> in which reſpect, in ſome places they put Aſhes on the Bridegroom's head: he weareth for this cauſe a black Hood on his Head, like a Mourner, and the Bride like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife weareth a black Cloath, fit to terrifie Children with the Deformity, Thus do they mix Mirth and Mourning, as <hi>David</hi> warneth, <hi>Rejoyce unto him in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> This ended, they ſit down at Table, and then muſt the Bridegroom make Tryal of his Breaſt in ſinging a long Prayer; others in the mean time call to make ready the Hen. Then is there an Hen and an Egg ſet before the Bride; of that the Bridegroom car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth her a piece, and then preſently all the Company, Men and Women, tear the Hen amongſt them like hungry Hounds, ſnatching out of each others Hands and Mouths, all to glad the new married Couple. The Egg is not ſod, but in another Scene of Mirth one caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in the face of another, of ſome <hi>Christian</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if any be preſent at the Nuptials: in the ſame is a Myſtery included for the Bride, that ſhe ſhall have as eaſie Travel in Child-birth as the Hen layeth her Eggs. After this they fall to their Chear and Dances: one they call the <hi>Mitzvah,</hi> or Commandment-dance, as if God had enjoyned it. The chief Gueſt takes the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom by the hand, another him, and ſo on through the Company: likewiſe the chief Woman takes the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46445:47"/>Bride, another her, and ſo one another; then do they dance in a long row with a tumultuous noiſe, and ſo end the Nuptial Sports. Amongſt all their other Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, the Bridegroom is to ſay one, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi perſpexerit ſanguinem Virginum,</hi> to uſe the words of <hi>Genebrad,</hi> who expreſſeth it, being borrowed from ſome Words of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> fleſhly abuſed by ſuch Application. The Marriage commonly laſteth eight days, and on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath they dance the luſtieſt of all, doing the Sabbath herein a ſingular Honour, becauſe that alſo is called a Bride. It is prohibited to bid any uncircumciſed Gueſt to this Banquet; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, The Stranger doth not intermeddle with his Joy: yea, the good Angels ſeeing ſuch there, will depart; and the evil will come and raiſe Strifes and Contentions: for they think no place empty from the Earth to the Sky, but all full of good or bad Angels, flying or ſtanding in the ſame. The Marriage is in publick, leſt Whoredom ſhould be covered under that Pretext, pretending themſelves mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried when they were not.</p>

The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band oweth ten things to the Wife; three according to the Law, her Nouriſhment, her Cloathing, and her Time, namely, of due Benevolence to be performed; and ſeven things according to the Words of the <hi>Scribes;</hi> the firſt whereof is the Foundation of Dowry, <hi>viz.</hi> two hundred <hi>Denarii,</hi> if ſhe be a Virgin, otherwiſe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The other concern the Condition of the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Woman which rendreth not her Husband his due, is rebellious and refractory; and he is bidden to expell her without a Dowry. The Conditions of the Dowr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> were, firſt, to cure her in Sickneſs, ſecondly, to redeem her, being captive; thirdly, to bury her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead; fourthly, to nouriſh her out of his own Goods, and that ſhe dwell in his Houſe in her Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-hood; fifthly, to keep her Daughters till Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; fixthly, that her Sons inherit. They appoint not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46445:48"/>only Love but Honour to the Wife (as <hi>Peter</hi> alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth to this weaker Veſſel) which Honour they ſay is Meat and Drink, and goodly Garments; for which he ſhall (this was a Woman's Friend) have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God. The Author of <hi>Arbaa Turim</hi> addeth, That a Man ſhould love his Wife as his own Body, and honour her above his Body, and keep her as one of his Members; for the Wife is the other half of Man, and a Wife without a Man is but half a Man. And let him take heed of ſtriking his Wife, ſaid another, or to be virulent in terms againſt her: for, for her Tears (how pitifully eaſie are they to ſome) his Puniſhment is near. And howſoever, ſince the Deſtruction of the Temple, <hi>the door of Prayers hath been ſhut,</hi> yet the door of Tears hath not been ſhut, as ſaith <hi>David, Be not thou ſilent at my Tears.</hi> And ſhould not a Man honour his Wife? Yes, ſaith <hi>R. Hanina,</hi> for a Man hath no Bleſſing but for his Wife, as it is written, <hi>He bleſſed</hi> Abraham <hi>for her.</hi> Let a Man cloath himſelf (I would not have Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hear it) beneath his Ability, his Children accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Ability, and his Wife above his Ability. Let the Wife honour her Husband as her Father, and fear to diſpleaſe him, and let him ſpare her in his Anger, remembring that ſhe was taken out of his Ribs: But for the Wives choice, a Man ought, ſaith one, to ſell all that he hath, and buy a Wife, the Daughter of a wiſe Diſciple; if he find not ſuch a one, let him take a Daughter of the Great Men of his time; if not ſuch, the Daughter of a Synagogue Ruler, in that defect let him take the Daughter of one which gathereth Alms; if not, then of a School-Maſter, and not the Daughter of the People of the Land, of whom the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Curſed be he that lyeth with a Beast.</hi> They ſay that a Man ought not to lodge in the ſame Chamber, no not with his Siſter, Daughter, or Daughter-in-law; yea, their wiſe Men forbid Conference with a Woman alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p n="67">LXVII. But now it will be convenient to proceed to their way of Divorce and other Marriage-Ceremonies. The Bill of Divorce is ſtill practiſed among the <hi>Jews;</hi> it muſt be written in twelve Lines, (it is therefore called <hi>Get</hi>) neither more nor leſs, and delivered to the Woman before three credible Witneſſes, under their Hands and Seals. Then doth the Husband deliver it to her, ſaying, <hi>Lo Woman, the Bill of this Divorce, take it of me, by it being divorced from me, be thou free to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husband.</hi> The Tenor of this Bill is this; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day of the Week, the eight and twentieth of the Month, in the Year of the World, 5363. as we here at <hi>Mentz</hi> upon <hi>Rhine</hi> uſe to reckon; I <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Eckenderf,</hi> Son of <hi>R. Abr.</hi> now dwelling at <hi>Mentz,</hi> of my free Will, without Conſtraint, thee <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Trummerle,</hi> Daughter of <hi>R. Levi,</hi> which hitherto hath been my Wife, have determined to free, forſake, and divorce, and now do forſake, free, and put thee from me, that thou mayſt be thine own, and at thine own free Will and Pleaſure mayſt depart whither thou wilt, and none from henceforth for ever ſhall prohibit thee; and thou art ſo freed, that thou may'ſt marry to any other Man. This Divorce may not be done in every place, but they have ſome ſpecial place appointed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and known, ſcituate on ſome known River, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain chief <hi>Rabbies</hi> are called by writing, if there be none there dwelling, which conſummate the buſineſs. By the old Law a Woman might be reconciled to her Husband before the Bill of Divorce given, or after.</p>
               <p>The Obſervation of the Brother to marry the Wife of the Brother deceaſed without Iſſue, or elſe to loſe the Inheritance, which was teſtified by pulling off his Shooe, and ſpitting in his Face, is now thus ruled by the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> That none ſhall marry ſuch a Widdow, but rather ſuffer the premiſed Ignominy; which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this ſort; She comes before the chief <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> with five Witneſſes, where the <hi>Rabbi</hi> demands if ſhe have been three Months a Widdow, if her Husband
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46445:49"/>had a Brother unmarried, if the Party convented be he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and laſtly, if ſhe be faſting; (for otherwiſe ſhe might not ſpit in her Brothers Face) of him alſo the <hi>Rabbi</hi> likewiſe asketh like Queſtions; and receiving a denial of Marriage, there is brought a Shoo of ſingular Faſhion for that purpoſe, which he putteth on his right foot, bare, and then ſetteth himſelf againſt a Wall. The Woman comes, and diſclaiming his Affinity, ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and with her right hand (for if ſhe want a right hand it putteth the <hi>Rabbies</hi> out of their Wits to ſcan whether with her Teeth or how elſe it may be done) unlooſeth the Shoo, and taking it off, ſpits in his face; ſo that the five Witneſſes may ſee it, ſaying, Thus ſhall it be done with him which will not build the Houſe of his Brother. In the time of her Uncleanneſs, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may not enter into the Synagogue, nor pray, nor name the Name of God, nor handle any holy Book; which if they obſerve, the <hi>Rabbies</hi> promiſe them lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Life. As ſoon as ſhe knoweth of her Uncleanneſs, ſhe preſently ſeparateth her ſelf from her Husband the ſpace of ſeven days, not touching him, nor ſitting on the ſame Seat, nor eating in the ſame Diſh, or on the ſame Cloath, nor may drink out of the ſame Cup, nor ſtand againſt him, nor ſpeak in his Face: if one will give any thing to the other, one layeth it on a Bench or Table, and goeth away, and the other cometh and taketh it: they ſay it procureth the Leproſie in the Children which are then gotten, which they object to <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> When ſhe hath numbred ſeven dayes of her Uncleanneſs, ſhe proceedeth to number as many of her Purification; after which time, finding her ſelf pure, ſhe cloatheth her ſelf in white, and taking a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her, waſheth her ſelf in cold Water, (ſome in Winter put in warm Water to it, which others in the coldeſt Seaſon refuſe) and leaves not a hair of her Head unwaſhed, as before is deſcribed. Some faſt till they have done it, leſt the fleſh in the Teeth ſhould hinder the Water from coming to them; for Mouth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46445:49"/>and Eyes muſt be open, and they muſt ſtoop that the Pap keep not the Water from the Breaſt; and if they have a Plaiſter on a ſore it muſt off, and their Nails muſt be pared. They write, That if any ſhall exceed twenty years, and not marry, or if he ſhall marry a Wife which is barren, he ſinneth as much as if he had ſlain a Man, and deſerveth the Puniſhment of <hi>Onan,</hi> whom God ſlew, provided, if he addict himſelf to the Study of the Law, and findeth no need of a Wife; but if he find Concupiſcence prevail, he ought to marry notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And this neceſſity remaineth untill he hath begotten a Son and a Daughter. But having forgotten to ſpeak of Circumciſion under the Head of Religion, it will not be improper to touch ſomething upon that Point in this place. The Child is firſt waſhed and laid in clean Linnen; for if he be foul, or defile himſelf while he is circumciſed, the <hi>Mohel</hi> or Circumciſer is to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or interrupt his Prayer till he be waſhed again. In the Morning of the eighth day, the God-father ſeateth himſelf down in a Seat placed near the Ark, and the <hi>Mohel</hi> near him: twelve wax-candles are brought in to repreſent the twelve Tribes; then two Cups of red Wine, the circumciſing Knife, with two Diſhes, the one of Oyl, the other of Sand. When the Child is brought to the door by the Woman, the Congregation riſeth up, the God-father takes the Child and ſits down in his Seat. There is alſo a Seat prepared for <hi>Eliah,</hi> whoſe coming they expect at the Circumciſion. The Child is then named, and uſually by the name of ſome of his Anceſtors; ſo that <hi>Luke</hi> 1.61. it was wondred at that <hi>Zachary</hi> ſhould name his Son, <hi>John,</hi> ſeeing none of his Kindred was named with his Name. The eighth day was ſo ſtrictly obſerved, that if it fell on the Sabbath the Child was then circumciſed, not ſooner, leſt God ſhould be thought to be tied to the Sacrament; and becauſe the Child the firſt ſeven days after the Birth was held legally unclean, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in his Blood, <hi>Levit.</hi> 12.2, 3. and 22.27. nor
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46445:50"/>later, leſt the Parents ſhould be longer with-held from the comforts of the Sacrament. The penalty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or neglect of Circumciſion, was a <hi>cutting off from the People, Gen.</hi> 17.14. that is, by Excommunication, or bodily death of the Parents. Therefore God would have killed <hi>Moſes</hi> for not circumciſing his Son: or elſe by the death of the Son himſelf, when he comes to years of diſcretion, if he be not circumciſed, either by himſelf, or by his Parents, or by the Judges.</p>
               <p>Now the manner of the <hi>Mohel</hi>'s cutting off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, is, that he firſt rubs it, that it may be the leſs ſenſible, then bleſſeth God for the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and withall cuts off the fore-part of the skin, and flings it into the Sand, in memory of that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.12. <hi>I will make thee as the ſand of the Sea:</hi> then he ſpits ſome red Wine on the Wound, and waſheth it it, and ſome alſo on the Child's face, if he faint; and taketh the bleeding Member in his Mouth, and ſucks the blood from it, which he ſpits into the other cup of Wine, then he tears off the remaining skin with his ſharp-pointed Nails, and layeth Clouts dip'd in Oyl in the Wound, and bindeth them. Then he bleſſeth God again, and the God-father takes the other Cup of Wine, and prayeth for the Child. And the <hi>Mohel</hi> moiſtneth the Childs Lips with Wine and his own blood, and prayeth again. If the Child be ſick on the eighth day, his Circumciſion is deferred till he recover. If he dye before the eighth day, he is circumciſed at the Grave, but without Prayers.</p>
               <p>They redeem their Firſt-born. When the Child is one and thirty dayes old, he is ſet upon a Table by the Father, before the Prieſt, with as much money as two Dollars and an half.

If before this time the Father dyes, then the Mother ſignifieth by a Scroll about the Childs neck, that he is the firſt-born, and not redeemed; who, when he comes of age, is bound to redeem himſelf. He is held to be of juſt age to redeem himſelf, when he is thirteen years old, for then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſtand no more charged with his Sin, but he muſt himſelf bear his own burthen.</p>
               <p n="68">LXVIII. The ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> uſed to celebrate their Marriages in the Spring, and on their Marriage-day the Husband eats nothing but an Apple, or the Marrow of a Camel. As for the Marriages in <hi>New-Spain;</hi> The Bridegroom and the Bride ſtood together before the Prieſt, who took them by the hands, asking them if they would marry? Underſtanding their Will, he took a corner of the Veil wherewith the Woman had her head covered, and a corner of the mans Gown, which he tied together on a knot, and ſo led them thus tied to the Bridegroom's houſe, where there was a Hearth kindled. Then he cauſed the Wife to go ſeven times about the Hearth, and ſo the married couple ſat down together, and ſo was the Marriage contracted. In other places of that Countrey, an <hi>Amanteſa,</hi> or Broker, carried the Bride on her back at the beginning of the night, four Women attending with Torches of Pine-tree ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined. At the Bridegroom's houſe, his Parents receive her, and carry her to him in a Hall, where they are both cauſed to ſit on a Mat near the Fire, and tied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a corner of their Apparel, and a Perfume of Copale-wood is made to their Gods. Two old men and as many old women were preſent. The married couple eat, and then theſe old folks, which after this ſeparate them aſunder, and give them good inſtructions for Oeconomical Duties.</p>
               <p n="69">LXIX. In other parts of <hi>New-Spain,</hi> they uſed other Marriage Rites; at <hi>Thaxcalla</hi> the Bridegroom and Bride polled their Heads, to ſignifie, that from thenceforth all childiſh courſes ſhould be laid aſide. At <hi>Michuacan</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:46445:51"/>the Bride muſt look directly upon the Bridegroom, or elſe the Marriage was not perfect. In <hi>Mixteopan,</hi> they uſed to carry the Bridegroom upon their backs, as if he were forced; and then they both joyn hands, and knit their Mantles together with a great knot. The <hi>Macatecas</hi> did not come together in twenty dayes after Marriage, but abode in faſting and praying all that while, ſacrificing their Bodies, and anointing the Mouthes of their Idols with their blood. In <hi>Panuco,</hi> the Husbands buy the Wives for a Bow, two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and a Net; and afterwards the Father-in-law ſpeaketh not one word to the Son-in-law for the ſpace of a year. When he hath a Child, he lieth not with his Wife in two years after, leſt ſhe ſhould be with Child again before the other be out of danger. Some ſuck twelve years, and for this cauſe they have many Wives. No woman while ſhe hath her Diſeaſe, may touch or dreſs any thing.</p>
               <p n="70">LXX. Adultery in <hi>Mexico</hi> was death. Common Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were permitted, but no ordinary Stews. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did many times talk with their Prieſts, and ſome other Rulers and particular Perſons. Great gifts were offered to the man to whom the Devil had vouchſafed this Conference. He appeared unto them in many ſhapes, and was often familiar with them. He to whom he appeared, carried about him, painted, the likeneſs wherein he ſhewed himſelf the firſt time; and they painted his Image on their Doors, Benches, and every corner of the Houſe; and likewiſe according to his <hi>Protean</hi> and diverſified Apparitions, they painted him in many ſhapes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> who are well acquainted with <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> tell us, that at the Marriages of their Daughters, in thoſe Parts, they give half an Ounce of Gold to buy Wine for the Bridal; the King himſelf giveth no other Portion. The Bride, in the preſence of her Friends, ſweareth to be true to her Husband, which the man doth not. For Adultery he may divorce her, and the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46445:51"/>Adulterer payeth to the King four and twenty <hi>Peſos</hi> of Gold, and the Husband may alſo drive him out of Town: but the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> paid no Fine, therefore the Women were only blamed, and paid four <hi>Peſos.</hi> If the Husband ſuſpects his Wife, he makes tryal of her honeſty, by cauſing her to eat Salt, with divers of their Paganiſh Ceremonies, the fear whereof makes her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. They have many Wives, if they can buy and keep them; each dwelleth in a Houſe by her ſelf, tho there be ten of them; they eat and lodge aſunder; ſometimes they will bring their Cheer together. The Husband cloſely takes which he will have lye with him to his Room, where their Bed is a Mat. The Women after Travel waſh themſelves, and do not accompany with their Husbands for three Months after. The Child new born hath a clean Cloth wrapped about the middle, and is laid down on a Mat. The Mothers uſe to bear their Children at their backs, and ſo travel with them, none proving lame, notwithſtanding that ſhaking of their Bodies; they give them the Breaſt over their ſhoulders. When it is a Month old, they hang a Net about the Body, like a ſhirt, made of the Bark of a tree, hanged full of <hi>fetiſſo's,</hi> or their Idols, to ſecure it from the Devil, who otherwiſe would, they think, carry it away. They hang the hair full of ſhells, and Corals about the Neck, Arms, and Legs, applying divers fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſos or wreaths, with ſuperſtitious fancy, that one is good for vomiting, a ſecond for falling, a third for bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a fourth to make it ſleep, a fifth againſt wild Beaſts, and ſo in the reſt, giving to each <hi>fetiſſo</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral name. They quickly learn them to eat, and then leave them about the Houſe, like Dogs: they ſoon learn to go, to ſpeak, to ſwim: when they are firſt born, they are not black but reddiſh, as the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilians:</hi> Each Woman brings up her own: they teach them no Civility, and beat them ſometimes cruelly with ſtaves: when they are eight, or ten, or twelve years old they learn them to ſpin Bark-thread, and make Nets.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46445:52"/>After that, they go with their Fathers to fiſh: at eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years old they begin to ſet up for themſelves, two or three of them together hiring a Houſe and <hi>Canoe:</hi> and then they cover their Privities, grow amorous, and their Fathers look out Wives for them. They have little Hair on their face at thirty; they wear Nails as long as the Joynt of a Man's Finger, as a token of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, which is alſo obſerved by Merchants; they keep them very clean, and as white as Ivory; they are great in Fleſh, beyond Men of theſe Parts; at three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten, or fourſcore, their blackneſs decays, and they grow yellow; they have ſmall Bellies, long Legs, broad Feet, long Toes, ſharp Sight, quick Wit, Eſtridge maws; are ſpiteful, curiouſly neat, Drunkards, Thieves, leacherous, and ſubject to the Pox, whereof they are not aſhamed, as neither of ſhewing their Nakedneſs.</p>
               <p n="71">LXXI. If a Man amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> liketh a young Woman, he buyeth her of her Father, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolleth her in the <hi>Cadies</hi> Book, the Marriage following with all <hi>Bacchanal</hi> Solemnities. Many Women are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Brides Mother the Night before, when after the feaſting they bathe her, and the next Morning trick her in her richeſt Ornaments, tying on her ſilken Buſkins, with Knots not eaſily unknit; (which the Bridegroom muſt untie, though with his Teeth) after that, with much Solemnity, his Companions on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, riding two in a Rank, and conducted by the <hi>Sacdiſh,</hi> who is neareſt of his Kindred, have fetched her home, the Bride being delivered with her Face cloſe covered, ſet a ſtride on Horſe-back, with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy over her head, and received of him at his door; thence led, if ſhe be of Quality, by an Eunuch, to the Bride-Chamber. The Gueſts honour him with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, yet go not in: The Father alſo giveth only ſome pieces of Houſhold ſtuff, carried openly by Particulars through the Streets. Now he is to entertain the VVives with an equal Reſpect. Alike is their Diet, Apparel, yea, and Benevolence (unleſs they conſent to change
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46445:52"/>and give turns) or elſe they may complain to the <hi>Cady,</hi> and procure a Divorce; but the Husband may put away his VVives at pleaſure, who may marry unto another within five Months after, except ſhe prove with Child, and then ſhe muſt ſtay ſo long after her delivery: but if he will have her again he muſt buy her; and if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third Divorce, another is firſt to lye with her as a Puniſhment of his Levity. They will ſell ſome of them, or give them to their Slaves: the VVives give him the reverence of a Maſter. They are at no time to deny him their Embracements; whom he toucheth not again, untill he hath been at the Bath. They hold their Chaſtiſement, which they receive from him, as an Argument of Affection. They intermeddle not with Houſhold Affairs, only it is required of them to content their Husbands, to nurſe their own Children, and to live peaceably together, which alſo they do without Jealouſie or Envy. They are exceeding beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, for the moſt part ruddy, clear and ſmooth as the poliſhed Ivory, tender and ſoft, as frequenting the Baths daily, and never open to the Weather, but wither quickly. Great and black Eyes are the greateſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Eyes of a <hi>Turk.</hi> They ſit not at Table with their Husband, but wait and ſerve them: and then they dine by themſelves, admitting no Mankind with them above twelve Years old; and they never go abroad without leave, except to the Bath, and on <hi>Thurſday</hi> to weep at the Graves of the dead; they riſe to their Husbands, and ſtand while they are in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and beſides them, come in no Company of men, nor do they ſpeak with a Man, or in any other part of their Body are ſeen of any Man, becauſe they think ſight, eſpecially where Beauty and Comlineſs is, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without ſin; only the Brother may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee the Siſter, but not the Husband's Brother: yea, their Sons, when they come to growth are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them. For this cauſe that Sex is not ſuffered to buy and ſell, but is cloſely mewed, ſave that their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46445:53"/>Law alloweth them to frequent the publick Baths The Wife and Concubine differ in the right to a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the latter wanteth; but the Wife muſt cauſe the other to be her Husband's Bed-fellow when he commandeth, without gain-ſaying, except on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or Friday nights, which is the Wives peculiar. Yet are the <hi>Turks</hi> given in both Sexes to unnatural Luſts, even the Women in publick Baths, ſometimes are ſo inflamed in that Filthineſs as is intollerable. <hi>Busbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius</hi> tells of one Woman, who falling in love with a young Maid, and no way elſe prevailing, cloathed her ſelf in Man's Apparel, and hiring a Houſe near, procured the Fathers good Will to have that his Daughter in Marriage; which being ſolemnized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the truth diſcovered (which black Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Night could not cover them from <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Torch) Complaint was made, and the Governour quenched the hot flames of this new Bridegroom, cauſing her to be drowned for that offence. If the Man abuſe the Wife to unnatural Luſt, ſhe may have her Remedy by Divorce, if ſhe accuſe her Husband; which Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty forbiddeth to be done in Words, and therefore ſhe puts off her Shoe, and by inverting the ſame accuſeth her Husband's Perverſeneſs. There are ſome <hi>Turks</hi> who keep Boys gallantly arrayed, to ſerve for the worſe than beaſtly Luſt of ſuch as will hire them. They have this loathſome Puniſhment for that loathſome Sin of Whoredom; to take the Paunch of a Beaſt new killed, and cutting a Hole thorough, to thruſt the Adulterers Head in this Dung-Wallet, and ſo carry him in Pomp thorough the Streets. It is Death either to the Body by Judicial Sentence, or the Soul, by turning <hi>Turk,</hi> for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to have carnal Dealing with any of their Women. A <hi>Jew</hi> who had dealing with a <hi>Turk</hi>'s Wife, with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Conſent, could not eſcape hanging therefore, (this indeed was a favour, for he ſhould have been burned) notwithſtanding his rich Countrey-men
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46445:53"/>offered two thouſand Duckats to ſave him: her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was hanged for his wittally Perſwaſion, and ſhe her ſelf drowned. It is certain, that they buy Boys of an hundred or two hundred Duckets, and mew them up for their filthy Luſt, till they prove bearded: they will alſo ſteal Boys for that Villany.</p>
               <p n="72">LXXII. In <hi>Negapatan,</hi> upon the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> the manner of their Marriages is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; for, many times the Prieſt, with a Cow, and the Man and Woman, go together to the Water-ſide, where the <hi>Bramane</hi> firſt mutters a ſhort Prayer, and then links their Hands about the Cow's Tail, pours upon them all his hallowed Oyl, and laſtly, forces the Beaſt into the River, whereinto ſhe goes willingly ſo far as till they be to the middle in Water; neither returns ſhe, nor do they diſunite till the Waves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them; when being on ſhore they unite, and hold that myſterious Tye forcible and ſacred ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p n="73">LXXIII. The Manner of the <hi>Tartars</hi> wedding is as follows. The Husband covenanteth with the Father of the Maid; who having given him power to take her whereſoever he ſhall find her, he ſeeketh her among ſome of her Friends, where ſhe hath then of purpoſe hidden her ſelf, and by a kind of force carryeth her away. They marry with any except their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Siſter: Their Widdows ſeldom marry, becauſe of their Service to their former Husbands in another World, except the Son marry his Fathers Wives, or the Brother his Brother's, becauſe they can there in the next World be content to reſign them to their former Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands again. The Women ſell and provide all Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries into the Houſe, the Men intending no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their Arms, Hunting, and Hawking. If one hath buried a Male-child, and another a Female, the Parents contract a Marriage between thoſe two, and painting in Papers, Servants, Horſes, Cloaths, and Houſhold, and making Writings for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46445:54"/>of the Dower, burn theſe things in the Fire, by the ſmoke whereof, they (in their ſmoky conceits) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine all theſe things to be carried and confirmed to their Children in the other world; and the Parents of the two dead Parties claim kindred each of other, as if they indeed had married their Children whilſt they lived: yet they do not account the woman they have married a Wife, until ſhe hath honoured them with the name of a Father, and then beginneth he to take Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her Friends, of Horſes, Sheep, Kine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if ſhe be barren, after a certain time he turneth her home again.</p>
               <p n="74">LXXIV. In <hi>China</hi> their Marriages and Eſpouſals want not many Ceremonies; both are done in their Youth: they like equality of age and ſtate betwixt the Parties. The Parents make the Contracts, not asking the Childrens conſent, neither do they ever refuſe. As for their Concubines, every one keeps according to his pleaſure and ability, reſpecting in them eſpecially their Beauty; and buy them for the moſt part, their price being an hundred Crowns, or leſs. The common People alſo buy their Wives, and ſell them at their pleaſure. The Magiſtrates marry in their own Rank their Legitimate wife. This chief wife only fits at Table with her husband, the reſt (except in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Families) are as Servants, which in the preſence of either of the former may not ſit but ſtand. Their Children alſo call that wife their Mother, not their Natural Parent, and for her Funerals alone ſolemnize three years mourning, or leave their Office; not for their own Mother. In theſe Marriages they are very ſcrupulous, that the Wife have not the ſame ſirname with her Husband, although there be no kindred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and the ſirnames in <hi>China</hi> are not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, neither may any deviſe new, but muſt have one, and that the ſame which their Anceſtors by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide (not the Mothers) had, except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted into another Family. They had no degrees of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46445:54"/>Affinity or Conſanguinity, ſo the ſirname differ, and therefore marry in the Mothers Kindred, be it almoſt never ſo near. The Bride brings no Portion to her Husband, and yet the firſt day ſhe comes to his Houſe, ſhe hath to attend abundance of Houſhold-furniture, even the Streets being filled with it, all at the Husbands coſt, who ſome Months before ſends her a great Sum of Money to this purpoſe. There are many, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor, do for Luſt make themſelves Slaves to rich men, that ſo they may be furniſhed with a wife amongſt his Women-Slaves; whereby alſo the Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perpetually bond. Others buy their wives, but ſeeing their increaſing Family grow chargeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their ability, ſell their young Sons and Daughters at the ſame price they would ſell a Swine or Beaſt, or ſome two or three Duckats more; yea, though they be not by Dearth compelled thereto.</p>
               <p n="75">LXXV. If any Merchant reſort into <hi>Pegu,</hi> he ſhall have many Maids offer'd him by their Parents, to take his choice, and having agreed with the Parents, he may for the time of his abode uſe her as his Slave, or his Concubine, without any diſcredit to her. Yea, if he come again after ſhe is married, he may for the time he ſtayeth there, demand her in like ſort to his uſe. And when a man marrieth, he will requeſt ſome of his Friends to lye the firſt night with his Bride. There are alſo among them, that ſow up the privy Parts of their Daughters, leaving only paſſage for Urine; which, when they marry, paſs under the Surgeons hand for Remedy.</p>
               <p n="76">LXXVI. The Marriages of the <hi>Bengalans</hi> are after this ſort; The man and woman come to the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where ſtandeth a <hi>Bramane</hi> or Prieſt, with a Cow and a Calf, or a Cow with Calf: Theſe all go into the water together, the <hi>Bramane</hi> holding a white Cloth of four yards long, and a Basket croſs bound, with divers things in it. This cloth he layeth upon the back of the Cow, by the Tail, and ſaith certain words. She hath a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46445:55"/>Copper or braſs Pot full of Water. The Man holdeth his hand by the <hi>Braman</hi>'s Hand, and the Wives hand by her Husbands, and all have the Cow by the Tail. Then they pour Water out of the Pot upon the Cow's Tail, which runneth thorough all their hands, and they lade up Water with their hands, and then the <hi>Bramane</hi> tieth their Cloaths together. After this, they go round about the Cow and Calf, and give ſomewhat to the Poor there attending, leaving the Cow and Calf for the <hi>Braman</hi>'s uſe, and offer to divers of their Idols Money; then lying down upon the ground, they kiſs it divers times, and go their way</p>
               <p n="77">LXXVII. The young men in <hi>Arabia</hi> may go a wooing to divers Maids, till ſuch time as they have ſped of a Wife; yea, the Father of the Maid moſt friendly welcometh her Suitor; ſo that I think ſcarce any Noble or Gentleman among them can chooſe a Virgin for his Houſe: albeit, ſo ſoon as any Woman is married ſhe is quite forſaken of all her Suitors, who then ſeek out new Paramours for their liking.</p>
               <p n="78">LXXVIII. The <hi>Bramanes</hi> marry but once, and that not all, but only the eldeſt of the Brethren, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Succeſſion, who is alſo Heir of the Father's Subſtance, and keepeth his Wife ſtraitly, killing her, if he find her adulterous, with Poyſon. The younger Brethren lye with other Mens Wives, who account the ſame as a ſingular Honour done unto them, having Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enter into any Man's houſe, yea, of the Kings, no leſs than of the Subjects, of that Religion; the Husbands leaving the Wives, and the Brethren their Siſters unto their Pleaſures, and therefore departing out of the Houſe when they come in; and hence it is, that no Man's Son inheriteth his Fathers Goods, but the Siſter's Son ſucceedeth, as being moſt certain of the Blood. So in the Kingdom of <hi>Calicat,</hi> when the King marrieth a Wife, one of the principal <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> hath the firſt Nights lodgings with her, for which, he hath aſſigned him by the King, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46445:55"/>or five hundred Ducats. The King committeth the Cuſtody of his Wife to the <hi>Bramanes</hi> when he travelleth any whither, and taketh in too honeſt part their diſhoneſt Familiarity: but, for this cauſe the King's Son ſucceedeth not in the Crown, but his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Son, as being certainly of his Blood. Theſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the King chooſe what Gentleman they pleaſe on whom to beſtow their Virginity; and if they prove not in a certain time to be with Child, they betake them to theſe <hi>Bramane</hi> Stallions: the Gentlemen and Merchants have a Cuſtom to exchange VVives, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of great Friendſhip. Some VVomen amongſt them have ſix or ſeven Husbands, fathering her Children on which of them ſhe beſt pleaſeth. The Men when they marry, get others to uſe them if they be Virgins, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty days before they themſelves will bed them.</p>
               <p n="79">LXXIX. As for the Marriages in <hi>Peru,</hi> the Men had many VVives, but one was principal, which was wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Solemnity, and that in this ſort. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom went to the Bride's Houſe, and put <hi>O Hoya,</hi> which was an open Shoe, on her foot; this, if ſhe were a Maid, was of VVool, otherwiſe, of Reeds: and this done, he led her thence with him. If ſhe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Adultery ſhe was puniſhed with Death. VVhen the Husband died, ſhe carried a mourning VVeed of black a Year after, and might not marry in that time, which befell not the other VVives. The <hi>Ingua,</hi> or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himſelf, with his own hand, gave this VVoman to his Governours and Captains, and the Governours aſſembled all the young Men and Maids in one place of the City, where they gave to every one his VVife, with the aforeſaid Ceremony in putting on the <hi>O Hoya;</hi> the other VVives did ſerve and honour this. None might marry with his Mother, Daughter, Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Grand Child: and <hi>Yupangui,</hi> the Father of <hi>Guayanacapa,</hi> was the firſt <hi>Ingua</hi> that married his Siſter, and confirmed his Fact, by a Decree, That the <hi>Ingua</hi>'s

In the <hi>Canaries</hi> they uſed for Hoſpitality to let their Friends lye with their VVives, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theirs in like courteſie: and therefore, as in <hi>India,</hi> the Siſters Son inherited. Amongſt the <hi>Georgians</hi> too, the Husband bringing home a Gueſt, commends him to his VVIfe and Siſter, with charge to yield him Content and Delight, eſteeming it a Credit that their VVives can pleaſe and be acceptable. Their Virgins become Mothers very ſoon; moſt of them at ten years old can bring witneſſes in their Arms, (little bigger than a great Frog, which yet after grow tall and ſquare men) to prove that there is never a Maid the leſs for them. So in <hi>Chamul,</hi> a Province in <hi>Tartary,</hi> they not only permit, but account it a great Honour to have their VVives and Siſters at the pleaſure of ſuch Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as they entertain, themſelves departing the while, and ſuffering all things to be their Gueſts VVill; for ſo are their Idols ſerved, who therefore for this Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, they think, will proſper all that they have. And when one of their <hi>Chams</hi> forbad them this beaſtly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, they abſtained three Years, but then ſent a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Embaſſage to him, with requeſt, that they might continue their former Cuſtom, for ſince they left it they could not thrive; who, overcome by their fond Importunity, granted their Requeſts; which they with Joy accepted, and do ſtill obſerve.</p>
               <p n="81">LXXXI.

There too, when a VVoman is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46445:56"/>delivered of a Child, the Man lieth in, and keepeth his Bed, with Viſitation of Goſſips the ſpace of forty days: they worſhip the ancienteſt Perſon in the houſe, aſcribing to him all their good. In ſome part of the Country, Knights and Souldiers never marry, but lye with ſuch Women or Daughters as like them, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his VVeapon mean while at the door, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any Man elſe, although it be the good man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to enter till he hath ended his Buſineſs, and be gone. At a place in the Kingdom of <hi>Fez,</hi> there was a Temple built; to which, at certain times in the Year, reſorted Men and VVomen in the night; where, after Sacrifices, the Candles were put out, and each Man lay with the VVoman he firſt touched. Thoſe Women were forbidden to lye with any other for a Year after. The Children begotten in this Adultery were brought up by the Prieſts of the Temple.</p>
               <p>But, having ſpoken of the ſtrange Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies uſed in Marriage by many Nations of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, it will not be unſeaſonable to give ſome Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch unnatural Wives and Husbands, as we meet with recorded in Hiſtory.</p>

               <p n="90">XC. 1. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1652. in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> lived one <hi>Adam Sprackling,</hi> Eſquire, who about twenty Years before had married <hi>Katharine,</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>Robert Leukner</hi> of <hi>Kent.</hi> This <hi>Sprack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> had a fair Eſtate, but had exhauſted it by Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At laſt Executions were out againſt him, and he forced to keep home and make his Houſe his Priſon: This filled him full of Rage, ſo that his Wife was conſtrained many times to lock her ſelf from him. But, upon <hi>Saturday</hi> night, <hi>Dec.</hi> 11. 1652. as it ſeems, he reſolved to miſchief her; and being at ten a Clock at night in his Kitchin, he ſent for one <hi>Martin,</hi> a poor old Man, out of his Bed to him; ſo that there
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46445:59"/>were in the Kitchin, <hi>Sprackling</hi> and his Wife, one <hi>Ewell,</hi> and this <hi>Martin; Sprackling</hi> commanded <hi>Martin</hi> to bind <hi>Ewell</hi>'s Legs, which the one did, and the other ſuffered, thinking it had only been a ranting humour of their Maſter: then he began to rage againſt his Wife, who ſat quietly by; and though ſhe gave him none but ſweet and loving words, yet he drew his Dagger, and ſtruck her over the face with it, which ſhe bore patiently, though ſhe was hurt in the Jaw. He ſtill continuing to rage at her, ſhe weary and in great fear, roſe up, and went to the door; Her Husband followed her with a chopping-knife in his hand, with which he ſtruck at her wriſt, and cut the bone in ſunder, ſo that her hand hung down, only by the Sinews and Skin. No help was near; <hi>Ewell</hi> was bound, and <hi>Martin</hi> being old and weak durſt not interpoſe, fearing his own Life, only prayed his Miſtris to ſtay and be quiet, hoping all ſhould be well, and ſo getting a Napkin bound up her hand with it. After this, towards Morning, ſtill rayling and raging at his Wife, he daſhed her on the Forehead with the Iron Cleaver, Whereupon ſhe fell down bleeeding but reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her ſelf on her Knees, ſhe cryed and prayed unto God for the pardon of her own and her Husband's Sins: praying God to forgive him as ſhe did; but as ſhe was thus praying, her bloody Husband chopt her head in the midſt of the very Brains, ſo that ſhe fell down and died immediately. Then did he kill ſix Dogs, four of which he threw by his Wife; and after ſhe was dead chopping her twice into the Legs, compelled <hi>Martin</hi> to waſh <hi>Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>'s Face with her Blood, himſelf alſo dipping Linnen in her Blood, waſhed <hi>Martin</hi>'s face, and bloodied his own face with it.

All the day ſhe reſted not, the ſtrength of her Love ſupporting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy of her Body; by this good means <hi>Valdaura</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped that danger. After this, by reaſon of a ſharp hot Rheum falling from his Brain, the Griſtle within his Noſe began to be eaten away, wherefore the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans appointed a certain Powder to be blown up ſoftly into his Noſe at certain times with a Quill; No Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could be found to take ſuch a loathſome ſervice in hand, becauſe of the ſtench that came from him; but <hi>Clara</hi> did it cheerfully; and when his cheeks and chin were all covered over with Scabs, Wheals, and Scales, ſo as no Barber could or would ſhave him, ſhe with her her little Sciſſers play'd the Barber, and made him a deft Beard. From this ſickneſs he fell into another, which laſted ſeven years, during which time, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diligence ſhe made ready his meat, put in his tents, laid on his plaiſters, dreſſed and bound up his thighs, all rotten with Scabs and Ulcers, his breath was ſuch, that none durſt come near by ten paces and abide by it, which yet ſhe proteſted was ſweet to her. This long ſickneſs, and the nouriſhing and medicining of a Body oppreſſed by ſo many Diſeaſes, was a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a houſe that had no Rents or profits coming in, and where Trade had ceaſed of a long time, and conſequently the gain; ſhe therefore, to furniſh the expences, ſold her precious Jewels, her gold Chains, her rich Carcanets, her Garments of great value, a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board of Plate, not caring for any thing ſo her Husband was relieved, and contenting her ſelf with little, ſo he wanted nothing. Thus <hi>Valdaura</hi> lingred on a Life, by the help of his Wife, within a rotten Body, or rather within a Grave, for twenty years together, in which time ſhe had eight Children by him, yet neither ſhe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46445:66"/>nor they had ſo much as a Scab, Wheal, or Pimple in any part of their Bodies. <hi>Valdaura</hi> died an old man, for whoſe death his Wife <hi>Clara</hi> made ſuch mourning, as they who knew her well ſay, never Woman did for any Husband. When ſome, inſtead of comforting her, told her, God had done much in taking him away, and that they therefore came to congratulate with her, ſhe deteſted their Speeches, wiſhing for her Husband again, in exchange of five Children; and though ſhe was yet both young and luſty, and ſought to by many, ſhe reſolved not to marry, ſaying, ſhe could never meet with any whom ſhe could like ſo well as her dear <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Valdaura.</hi>

               <p n="117">CXVII. There were three Brothers, who upon the Death of the King their Father, fell out amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about Succeſſion in the Kingdom: at laſt they agreed to ſtand to the Judgment and Determination of a neighbour King, to whom they fully referred the matter. He therefore commanded the dead Body of the Father to be fetched out of his Monument, and ordered that each of them ſhould ſhoot an Arrow at his Heart; and he that hit it, or came the neareſt to it, ſhould ſucceed, The Elder ſhot firſt, and his Arrow paſſed through the Throat of his Father: The ſecond Brother ſhot his Father into the Breaſt, but yet miſſed his Heart: The Youngeſt deteſting this Wickedneſs, <hi>I had rather,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>yield to all my Brothers, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reſign up all my Pretences to the Kingdom, than to treat the Body of my Father with this Contumely.</hi> This Saying of his conſidered, the King paſſed Sentence, that he alone was worthy of the Kingdom, as having given evidence how much he excelled his Brothers in Virtue, by the Piety he had ſhewed to the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Father.</p>
               <p n="118">CXVIII. The Pretor had ſentenced to death a Woman of good Birth for a Capital Crime, and had conſign'd her over to the Triumvir to be kill'd in Priſon; the Jaylor that received her, mov'd with compaſſion, did not preſently ſtrangle her, but beſides permitted her Daughter for to come often to her, though firſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched, leſt ſhe ſhould convey in any Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to her, the Jaylor expecting that ſhe ſhould dye of Famine.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46445:67"/>her Daughter with greater curioſity, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered how with the Milk in her Breaſts ſhe allayed the Famine of her Mother. The news of this ſtrange Spectacle, of the Daughter ſuckling her Mother, was by him carried to the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> by the <hi>Triumviri</hi> to the Pretor, from the Pretor it was brought to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conſul, who pardoned the Woman as to the Sentence of Death paſſed upon her, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Memory of that Fact, where her Priſon ſtood they cauſed an Altar to be erected to Piety.</p>

There was a Comet ſeen in the day time, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Weſt to the Eaſt, caſting an infinite number of Sparkles; and, they ſay, the form was like to a Tail, having three Heads. The great Lake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Teſcuco,</hi> without any Wind, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, or any other apparent ſign, began ſuddenly to ſwell, and the Waves grew in ſuch ſort, as all the Buildings near unto it fell down to the Ground. They ſay, at that time they heard many Voices, as of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Labour, which ſaid ſometimes, <hi>O my Children, the time of your Deſtruction is come:</hi> and other whiles it ſaid, <hi>O my Children! Whither ſhall I carry you that you periſh not utterly?</hi> There appeared likewiſe many Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with two Heads, which being carried before the King, ſuddenly vaniſhed. There were two that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all other Monſters, being very ſtrange; the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46445:74"/>one was, the Fiſher-men of the Lake took a Bird as big as a Crane, and of the ſame colour, but of a ſtrange and unſeen form. They carried it to <hi>Montezuma,</hi> who at that time was in the Palace of Tears and Mourning, which was all hanged with black; for as he had many Palaces for his Recreation, ſo had he alſo others for times of Affliction, wherewith he was then heavily charged and tormented, by reaſon of the Threatnings his Gods had given him by theſe ſorrowful Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Fiſhers came about Noon, ſetting this Bird before him, which had on the top of his Head a thing bright and tranſparent, in form of a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, wherein he did behold a Warlike Nation, coming from the Eaſt, armed, fighting and killing; he called his Diviners and Aſtronomers, (whereof there was a great number) who having ſeen theſe things, and not able to yield any reaſon of what was demanded of them, the Bird vaniſhed away, ſo as it was never more ſeen: whereupon <hi>Montezuma</hi> remained very heavy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful. The other which happened was, a Labourer, who had the report of a very honeſt Man, he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, telling him, that being the day before at his work, a great Eagle flew towards him, and took him up in his Talons, without hurting him, carrying him into a certain Cave, where it left him, the Eagle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing theſe Words, <hi>Most mighty Lord, I have brought him whom thou hast commanded me:</hi> This <hi>Indian</hi> Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er look'd about on every ſide, to whom he ſpake, but he ſaw no Man; then he heard a Voice which ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Dost thou not know this Man whom thou ſeeſt ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Ground?</hi> And looking then, he perceived a Man to lye very heavy aſleep, with royal Enſigns, Flowers in his Hand, and a Staff of Perfumes burning, as they are accuſtomed to uſe in that Country; whom the Labourer beholding, knew it was the great King <hi>Montezuma,</hi> and anſwered preſently, <hi>Great Lord, this reſembles our King</hi> Montezuma, The Voice ſaid again, <hi>Thou ſay'st true, behold what he is, and how he lies aſleep,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46445:75"/>careleſs of the great Miſeries and Afflictions prepared for him. It is now time that he pay the great number of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences he hath done to God, and that he receive the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Tyrannies and great Pride; and yet thou ſeest how careleſs he lies, blind in his own Miſeries, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any feeling. But to the end thou may'st the better ſee him, take the ſtaff of Perfumes he holds burning in his hand, and put it to his Face, then ſhalt thou find him without feeling.</hi> The poor Labourer durſt not approach near him, nor do as he was commanded, for the great fear they all had of this King. But the Voice ſaid, <hi>Have no fear, for I am without Compariſon greater than this King; I can deſtroy him and defend him: do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I command thee.</hi> Whereupon, the Labourer took the ſtaff of Perfumes out of the King's hand, and put it burning to his Noſe, but he moved not, nor ſhewed any feeling. This done, the Voice ſaid unto him, that ſeeing he had found the King ſo ſleepy, he ſhould go awake him, and tell him what he had ſeen. Then the Eagle, by the ſame Commandment, took the Man in his Talons, and ſet him in the ſame place where he found him; and for accompliſhment of that which he had ſpoken, he came to advertiſe him. They ſay, <hi>Montezuma</hi> looking on his Face, found that he was burn'd, the which he had not felt till then, wherewith he continued exceeding heavy and troubled.</p>
               <p n="132">CXXXII. It will not perhaps be an ungrateful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, to give the Reader a Compendium of the Fall and Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was uſhered in by prodigious Preſages and Comets.</p>
               <p>And amongſt other Preſignifications of it's Fall, there was one <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ananias,</hi> a Country-man, of mean Birth, four Years before the War againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> at a time when all was in deep Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, who coming up to the Feaſt of Tabernacles, according to the Cuſtom, began of a ſudden to cry out, and ſay, <hi>A Voice from the East, a Voice from the West, a Voice from the four Winds of the Heavens, a Voice against</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:46445:75"/>Jeruſalem, <hi>a Voice against the Temple, a Voice against the Bridegroom, a Voice against the Bride, and a Voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole People.</hi> Thus he went about all the narrow Lanes, crying Night and Day, ſo that they of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hated him, and ſaid unto him, Why cryeſt thou always this Cry? But the Governour of the City forbad them to wrong him, ſuppoſing he was mad; therefore for four Years ſpace he never left crying out, <hi>Woe to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and the Sanctuary thereof.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being apprehended and ſcourged, he continued the ſame Language under the Blows, without any other Word. And they upon this ſuppoſing (as it was) that it was ſome Divine Motion, brought him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Prefect; and by his Appointment being by Whips wounded, and his Fleſh torn to the Bones, he neither entreated nor ſhed Tear, but to every Blow, in a moſt lamentable mournful Note cried out, <hi>Woe, Woe, to</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. This he continued to do till the time of the Siege, ſeven Years together; and at laſt, to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary note of Woe to the City, the People, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, adding alſo, Woe to me, a Stone from the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fell down upon him, and killed him.</p>
               <p>The Year before the coming of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> there was ſeen a Star on the Temple, ſo bright as if a Man had ſo many drawn Swords in his hands. And the ſame time this Star appeared, which was at the ſolemn Paſſeover, that whole Night the Temple was light and clear as Mid-day, and continued ſo ſeven Nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Underſtanding Men knew well enough that this was an ill Augury, tho others thought it good. The ſame time alſo they brought a Heifer for a Sacrifice, which, when ſhe was knocked down, ſhe calved a Lamb.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there was a certain Gate, called the Eaſt-Gate, that was never opened nor ſhut, but twenty men had enough to do about it, and the creaking of the Hinges might be heard afar off; this Gate was found open without any Man's help, and they could not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:46445:76"/>ſhut it, till a great number joyned their Strength.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there was diſcerned on the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> a whole Night long, the face of a Man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful terrible.</p>
               <p>There appeared alſo the ſame time, four Chariots with Horſe-men, and great Blaſts in the Sky, coming towards <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the Feaſt of the Weeks, the Prieſts likewiſe heard a Man walking in the Temple, and ſaying with a great and wonderful terrible Voice, <hi>Come let us go away out of this Temple, let us hence away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time alſo, there was a Writing found graven in an old Stone, <hi>What time the Building of the Temple ſhould be brought to a four ſquare, then it ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Now when <hi>Antiochi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> was taken, and razed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Walls of the Temple were all bruiſed, the <hi>Jews</hi> making ſpeed to repair the Ruines and Dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, without Remembrance of the old Writing, they made the Temple four-ſquare. Beſides theſe Words, were found in the Walls of the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, When the whole Building of the Temple ſhall be four-ſquare, then ſhall a King reign over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and that King and Ruler ſhall reign over all the Land of</hi> Iſrael. Some interpreted this of the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the Prieſts ſaid it is the King of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe Preſages, it's Ruine might be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told from their Diviſions amongſt themſelves. For, there reigned at that time a Spirit of Diſſention in that Town, which divided the People into three parts; whereof the firſt and beſt followed <hi>Ananias</hi> the Prieſt, who at that time had ſtained, unhallowed, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Office of Prieſt-hood. Another Party followed ſeditious <hi>Jehochanan;</hi> the third was for <hi>Schimeon;</hi> ſo that in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Civil Wars while that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire under <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were levying all it's Forces for the levelling that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City to the Ground: for the Emperour being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and incenſed againſt them by their perpetual Rebellions, and by the ſlaughter of a vaſt number of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46445:76"/>
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they had inhumanely butchered and ſacrificed to their Fury. Now <hi>Ananias</hi> being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a godly Man, and ſeeing the Commonwealth of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> governed by the pleaſure of the Seditious, gave over his third part that ſtuck to him, to <hi>Eleazer</hi> his Son, who was the firſt Author of Sedition, and he that gave the firſt occaſion and the cauſe of all the Miſchief that befell to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the whole Land of <hi>Judaea:</hi> for, he began a Conſpiracy againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Garriſons, and provoked <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take away their Lives.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, there aſſembled to the ſeditious <hi>Eleazer, Jehuda, Chezron, Schimeon,</hi> and <hi>Chiskihu,</hi> young Men of the Nobles of <hi>Jeruſalem. Eleazer,</hi> with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, took the Temple and the Courts about it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing to his Men ſome to be Spies, and ſome to keep Watch and Ward about the Temple of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> who becauſe of the great Reſort of the People unto him, was ſtronger than <hi>Eleazer,</hi> he took the Market-place and Streets, and the lower part of the City.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Schimeon,</hi> the <hi>Jeruſalemite,</hi> took the higheſt part of the Town; ſo as that his men annoyed <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>'s part ſore with Slings and Croſs-bows,</p>
               <p>Between theſe three was alſo moſt cruel Battels in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the ſpace of five days, without ceaſing or any breathing, and every day were very many ſlain, ſo that the Blood of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were then ſlain ran in every place moſt abundantly through the Market places and Streets, even to the Temple of the Lord, like unto a Flood that had come of great Showers; and unto the Threſholds of the Gates of the Temple, the dead Bodies over-whelmed one another by heaps, for no man buried them. <hi>Jehochanan</hi> having the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle part of the Town, had <hi>Schimeon</hi> on the one ſide of him, and <hi>Eleazer</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Schimeon</hi> had the beſt place; from whence he might annoy both <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and <hi>Eleazer.</hi> The Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46445:77"/>did daily encreaſe and re-double, and many of the Prieſts and Elders aſſembling to the Temple, to beſcech that theſe domeſtick and inteſtine Enemies might not pollute and defile the Temple with their Slaughters, were almoſt all ſlain for their Pains. Amongſt others, was ſlain the Prieſt <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> a Prieſt; but of the chiefeſt Prieſts, <hi>Sechariahu</hi> alſo, the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prophet of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Then had the continual Sacrifice ceaſed thirty ſix days: for, ever untill that time were there ſome good Men or other of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that always offered Sacrifice to the Lord. And <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>And from the time that the continual Sacrifice ſhall be taken away, and Abomination ſhall be put into Deſolation, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ninety days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, when they would have continued it, and the Prieſts laid the Sacrifice upon the Altar, the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious would run upon them, and kill them, ſo that the Prieſts Bodies and their Cattel which they would have ſacrificed, ſhould fall dead to the ground together. They that reſorted alſo out of the Country to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for Devotions ſake, the Seditious ſlew, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, that few of them were left alive.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the dead Bodies of the Men lay caſt in the Temple, and that without number trod under foot: and the dead Body of the Prieſt that was offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, lay upon the Earth, together with his Offering. And when any Man would offer any Sacrifice, ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one or other of the Seditious would ſtep to him and kill him, that the Blood of the Sacrifice and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer ſhould be mingled together; inſomuch, that the Pavement of the Temple being all of Marble, was made ſo ſlippery with the Blood and Fat of thoſe that were ſlain, that no Man could go upon it without fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the Prieſt ſhould no ſooner lay hold on the Srcrifice, but ſtreight another dead Body ſhould fall upon him; Stranger or other they ſpared none: ſo thus the dead Bodies of the good and bad, clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46445:77"/>wicked and vertuous, Thief and True-man, lay one upon another, and their Blood mix'd together in the midſt of the Temple, without reſpect of any Man, of what Degree or Condition ſoever he were. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fight and Slaughter was great, both in the Town, and in the Temple. Nay, whomſoever the Souldiers overcame, they ſet fire on their Houſe alſo, whereby the Fire took into the great Mens Houſes that were nigh the Temple, and into the Store-houſes, whereas againſt times of Neceſſity, and beſieging of the Town, were laid up in ſtore, Corn, Wine, and Oyl, to the number of a thouſand and four hundred Store-houſes, all filled full of Victuals; for the Elders and other godly Men, what time as <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was in <hi>Galilee,</hi> they made up the doors of thoſe Garner-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and laid in Victuals into them, ſufficient for two hundred thouſand Men twenty Years: and now in this one Battel of the Seditious they were burn'd every one, which was a ſpeedy cauſe of Famine, and Hunger in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo, the Seditious pulled down and razed all the fair Houſes and goodly Buildings, that there ſhould be no Monument of any noble Houſe left to any in the City of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> So thus you ſee at that time the Lord viſited the Citizens of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with four kinds of Plagues, Sword, Peſtilence, Hunger, and Fire; beſides this, a fifth was added, the ruine and decay of all beautiful and glorious Buildings. And whereſoever a Man turned him, there was nothing but Deſolation, Pollution, (namely of the Temple and all holy things) Uproars, without all Reſt and Refuge; no Help, no Succour, but every Corner of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was full of howling and yelling, wailing and weeping, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and ſighing of Women and Children: here ſhould ye hear the roaring and groaning of wounded Men, not yet thorough dead; there the Mourning and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Elders; younger Children crying out for Hunger; to be ſhort, moſt ſorrowful Oppreſſion of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46445:78"/>them that lived, done by the Seditious, ſuch lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were made every where, that happy was he, that before this day died, and unhappy and in a woful caſe were all ſuch as remained alive to ſee this day.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>Titus</hi> was at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> making all manner of preparations for the laying Siege to this unhappy Town, and he received theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from his Father <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> by <hi>Joſeph</hi> a great man of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I ſend unto thee here, my beloved Son, <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Jews,</hi> a man of experience, trained in War, in whom is great Wiſdom; he ſhall be thy Father, and faithful Counſellor, thou ſhalt not do againſt his Counſel, neither one way nor other, for he is a Wiſe man, wherefore thou ſhalt reverence and honour him according to his Merits, for the Lord is with him, and believe not raſhly any man that defames <hi>Joſeph</hi> unto thee; rather put them to Death ſtreightway, that will accuſe him, for <hi>Joſeph</hi> is a faithful Man, and a good Counſellor; and who is ſo ruled by his Counſel ſhall have a proſperous ſucceſs in that he goeth about; therefore when <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhall come unto thee, after he hath refreſhed himſelf a few days of his Labour and Travels at the Sea; then ſhalt thou prepare thy Expedition againſt <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to beſiege it. And if the <hi>Jewes</hi> receive thee peaceably, and will ſubmit themſelves under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, then beware thou indamage them in nothing, but rather repair their Cities, and let them be free from all Tribute for the ſpace of two years; yet on this condition, that thrice every year they ſet a Flag with the Arms of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon their Walls, that is to ſay, at their three ſolemn Feaſts, when as all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were wont to reſort unto <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to appear before the Lord their God. Moreover, they ſhall offer for us every Feaſt a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, upon the moſt Holy Altar that is in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> And if they refuſe to make Peace with thee,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46445:78"/>thou ſhalt utterly raze their Town, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are left alive, and eſcape the Sword, thoſe ſhalt thou carry away captive. If they deſire to have <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for their King, we are content therewith. In any wiſe do not forget to be ruled by <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Counſel, he ſhall be thy Father and thou his Son.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being arrived at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſtayed with <hi>Titus</hi> there a whole month after he arrived from <hi>Rome.</hi> Then conſulted they together, to go to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege it; for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> underſtood well enough, that this came of the Lord, and that his Word could not be hindred. <hi>Titus</hi> therefore and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> with him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Alexandria</hi> with all their Army, and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Tents at <hi>Nicopolis;</hi> from thence they came by water to <hi>Thaniſa,</hi> ſo forth to <hi>Traclea,</hi> and leaving that, came to <hi>Pelieis,</hi> from thence they travelled thorough the Deſart to <hi>Baal-Iavin,</hi> after that to <hi>Dieron,</hi> ſo to <hi>Gaza,</hi> next to <hi>Aſcalon,</hi> then to <hi>Iabuam,</hi> after to <hi>Iapho,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Caeſarea.</hi> In theſe Journeys he won <hi>Aſam, Aſcalon</hi> and <hi>Iapho,</hi> with all their Towns and Caſtles lying about them.</p>
               <p>In the firſt year of the reign of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> the tenth Month, and the ſeventh day of the ſame, came <hi>Titus</hi> with <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Army to <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> a famous City, built by King <hi>Herod.</hi> In this City he ſojourned untill all his forces were rendevouzed, as well <hi>Romans,</hi> as other Nations that were under the Dominion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and came to aid them in the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Therefore <hi>Titus</hi>'s Army was wonderfully numerous and puiſſant, wherewith he abode at <hi>Caeſarea</hi> untill the Seaſon was fitting for a Campaign; and then taking his march from thence to <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Citizens of that place received him with great joy, and much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, wherefore he ſpared them and did them no harm.</p>
               <p>From thence he came to <hi>Apilona,</hi> thirty Furlongs from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he pitched his Tents, and leaving them there, he took ſix hundred Horſemen
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46445:79"/>with him, and came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to view the Town, to know what height the Walls were of, what ſtrength there was in the Town, eſpecially of the Seditious, of whom every where great rumour was; finally, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive peaceably all ſuch as were deſirous of Peace. But when he came to the Wall, he ſaw no man neither go out nor in, for the Gates were ſhut up, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious had laid an Ambuſh without the City to trap <hi>Titus,</hi> who went ſomwhat before accompanied with a few, the reſt following a pretty way behind. While therefore he was a viewing the Walls, the Seditious iſſued out of the Ambuſh that they had laid nigh unto <hi>Apilona,</hi> and ſet upon the back of <hi>Titus</hi>'s his Men behind. Then iſſued another party out of the Town, ſo that they had <hi>Titus</hi> between them, and running upon him, ſeparated him from his Men, and invironed him on every ſide; where they ſlew ſixty of his men, and might have ſlain him alſo, ſave that they coveted to take him alive. <hi>Titus</hi> ſeeing himſelf beſet, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of his own men, who thought that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to eſcape, perceiving alſo that they went not about to kill him, but to take him alive; moreover, that he could in no wiſe eſcape, except he would make an irruption, and run through their bands; he took heart, and valiantly brake thorough; ſlaying whomſoever came in his way to lay hands on him, and ſo eſcaped. If they had intended to have ſlain him, they might have done it, but being deſirous to take him alive (as he ſaid) they abſtained from ſtriking him and ſo they loſt him: and God did not deliver him into their hands, that by him he might ſcourge <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeeing him to be thus eſcaped, repented that they had not killed him; ſaying one to another, what meant we that we killed him not while we might? It was ill done of us: therefore they perſued him, hurling and ſhooting after him with Engins of War, but they could not overcome him, for God preſerved him, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46445:79"/>he might afterwards deliver <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into his hands; ſo he returned to <hi>Apilona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next morning brought <hi>Titus</hi> all his Army to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> determining to incamp himſelf upon the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where he accordingly pitched his Tents, right over againſt the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> that ran between the City and the Wall, and many times ran very ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Titus</hi>'s Camp was about ſix Furlongs from the Town.</p>
               <p>The next morning, they of the Town ſeeing <hi>Titus</hi> to be encamped on the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the Captains of the Seditious with their Companies aſſembled together, and fell to agreement every man with another, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to turn their cruelty upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> confirming and ratifying the ſame atonement and purpoſe, by ſwearing one to another, and ſo there was Peace among them. Wherefore joyning together thoſe that before were three ſeveral parties, they ſet open the Gates, and all the beſt iſſued out of them with a horrible noiſe and ſhout, that they made the <hi>Romans</hi> afraid withall, in ſuch wiſe that they fled before the Seditious, who ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly did ſet upon them at unawares. But <hi>Titus</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his men flee, rebuked and incouraged them to withſtand manfully the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that very many were ſlain on both ſides. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were not able long to abide the force of the <hi>Jews,</hi> albeit that <hi>Titus</hi> with his choiceſt and moſt valiant Souldiers did man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep their ground, and never retreated. <hi>Titus</hi> laboured and incouraged the reſt to fight; but they were ſo diſmai'd, that they wiſt not what to do. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>Titus</hi> and his men ſuſtained their efforts with that bravery and courage, that the <hi>Jews</hi> at length left the Field, and withdrew themſelves into the Town.</p>
               <p>The next day, <hi>Titus</hi> took all his Army ſave a few that he left in his Camp to keep his Baggage, and went down the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> ſetting his men in Battel array againſt the Gates of the City.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:46445:80"/>
               <p>Then exhorted he them to play the Men and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were come down the Hill, yet they ſhould not fear the <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning their Camp they had left behind them, for the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> ſaith he, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Camp and the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> With theſe words they were incouraged, and determined to incounter with the <hi>Iews</hi> under the Walls, hard by the Gates of the City, truſting to the ſafeguard and defence of the Brook <hi>Cedron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Captains of the Seditious likewiſe uſed Policy, for they, dividing their men, ſent one Company to paſs ſuddenly the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> to invade and ſpoyle the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp that was left in the Mount. Theſe therefore went and fought with the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Mount, and drove them out of ther Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> looking behind him, and perceiving that the <hi>Iews</hi> had gotten over the Brook, and were ingaged with his Men, he was in ſome kind of Conſternation, ſeeing himſelf invironed with Battels on every ſide.</p>
               <p>They within the Town, when they ſaw their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows once at the Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> they opened their Gates, iſſued out with all their Power that was left in the Town, and encountred with <hi>Titus,</hi> where he had ſet his men in array over againſt the Gate, where they made a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo that at length they betook them to flight over againſt Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and in their flight many of them were ſlain by the <hi>Iews</hi> that purſued the Chace. Upon this, divers of <hi>Titus</hi>'s Souldiers (ſeeing themſelves beſet both before and behind) counſelled <hi>Titus</hi> to flee with them to the Mountains to ſave his Life, leſt he ſhould be ſlain by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they altogether with him: for thou, ſay they, art a great Lord of many Kingdoms, and God ſhall one day bring thee to the Imperial Crown of our Lord thy father. Now therefore, if thou ſhould'ſt be ſlain by the <hi>Jews,</hi> we are all but dead; and what good ſhould thy Death do either to thy ſelf or to others, to be ſlain like one of us? <hi>Titus</hi> would not be ruled by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:46445:80"/>them, nor receive their Counſel, but kept his Ground boldly, without once turning his Face, ſaying, <hi>I will chooſe rather to dye with Honour than to live with Shame.</hi> And with that he ruſhed upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that were nigh him, and compelled them to recoil.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> that had environed the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp ſaw that, they left the <hi>Romans,</hi> and came flocking about <hi>Titus</hi> by Routs, aſſailing him on every ſide, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo with all their Might, to over-charge him; where in that place was a ſore and vehement Fight, and much People ſlain on both ſides: <hi>Titus</hi> eſcaped narrowly from being ſlain in that Fight, and had died indeed if certain of his valiant Souldiers had not rallied and returned unto him, and reſcued him out of the <hi>Jews</hi> hands. That day were the chief of <hi>Titus</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſlain: then the <hi>Jews</hi> retired to their place at the Walls ſide.</p>
               <p>They alſo who went to the Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> returned homeward by the Brook <hi>Cedron:</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing that, purſued them; whereupon, the <hi>Jews</hi> returned again upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> who fled by and by: Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> put the <hi>Romans</hi> to flight thrice upon one day.</p>
               <p>It came to paſs then, that the external Wars ceaſed, and inteſtine Civil Wars returned moſt terribly amongſt the Seditious at <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> for, upon the firſt day of the high ſolemn Feaſt of Paſſeover, Captain <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> and his Men, came into the Temple of the Lord, where he was honourably received of the Prieſts and Elders, with the reſt of the Commonalty. And when they were within, they caſt off their upper Garments, under which they were armed with Coats of Mail, and Swords tied to their Thighs. After that, they beſet the doors, and laid hold of the Prieſts, ſlew them and the People alſo, their Hearts were ſo cruelly bent againſt their Brethren, neither regarding the reverent Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Men, nor inclining to the Prayers of them that beſought them, without ſparing Women or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, no not the ſucking Babes.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:46445:81"/>
               <p>This done, <hi>Jehochanan</hi> ſtood up, and openly proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That neither <hi>Schimeon,</hi> nor <hi>Eleazer,</hi> nor any of the reſt of the Captains of the Seditious, nor any Man elſe, ſhould have Sovereignty in that City but he. The other hearing that <hi>Jehochanan</hi> had wrought ſuch Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the People of God in the Temple, roſe together, and ſlew very many of <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s Party: but in the mean ſeaſon, what of the one part and what of the other, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went to wrack, and were ſlain in great Numbers.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Then the <hi>Iews</hi> mock'd and flouted the <hi>Romans,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them freſh-Water Souldiers, Men of no Experience, and innocent Fools, that never ſaw the Trains of War before; clapping alſo their Targets, and ſhaking their Swords againſt them in Mockage. The <hi>Roman</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſeeing theſe things, they took great Diſdain, and in great Anger would have turned back upon the <hi>Iews</hi> again, had not <hi>Titus</hi> commanded the Retreat to be ſounded.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Titus</hi> had given Caution to his Officers for the preventing being any more deceived by the Wiles and Stratagems of their Enemies, conſidering how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly the <hi>Ieruſalemites</hi> were bent againſt one another, how they were become ſuch cruel Enemies, that each of them conſpired the other's Death, he cauſed the Pits, Ciſterns, and Trenches, that were about <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to be dam'd up, and ſtop'd with Earth, that the Ways might be levelled for his Army. This done, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd himſelf nearer the Walls: againſt which At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the <hi>Iews</hi> iſſued not out of the City after their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Manner, to put them back from the Walls. For <hi>Schimeon</hi> was otherwiſe buſied; he had entertain'd ten thouſand Men of the Seditious <hi>Iews,</hi> and joyned himſelf to <hi>Iacob</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> Captain of nine thouſand <hi>Edomites,</hi> with whom he had made a Conſpiracy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deſtroy Captain <hi>Jehochanan;</hi> and ſetting upon him, they compelled him to flee into the Court of the Temple, where he remained in the Gate of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46445:83"/>of the Temple, with eight thouſand and four hundred good Men of War, all well appointed in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazer</hi> alſo was againſt him, and joyned with <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> becoming an Enemy to him that before had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Life; and ſo they both together aſſail <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> neglecting the defence of the Town. By this means the <hi>Romans</hi> encamped themſelves about the Walls at their Pleaſure, raiſing Towers, and caſting Trenches to plant their battering Rams to beat down the Walls.</p>
               <p>The common People of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were under the Rule and Government of the three Seditious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, namely, <hi>Schimeon, Eleazer,</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> far paſſed <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and <hi>Schimeon</hi> was far worſe than <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer</hi> (tho <hi>Eleazer</hi> was the head Author and firſt Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sedition in all <hi>Iſrael</hi>) were amongſt them as a Sheep ready to be killed: for, the foreſaid Seditious Captains ſlew the People at their Pleaſure, and divided them into Bands, caſting Lots upon them, who ſhould have which, ſo that one had another's Men, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Men: and thus did they not only with their own Men, but alſo with all the reſt of the People, in ſuch wiſe, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> made any Aſſault, then joyned they together as one Man, to reſiſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> to whom, when they had given a Repulſe, then would they return to their Civil Wars, and fall together by the Ears among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Extream and dreadful was the Civil Conflict at that ſeaſon between the foreſaid Captains, and ſo ſore, that the Blood ſtreamed down the Channel out of the Gates of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> like as a Brook that runneth out of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Well-ſpring,</p>
               <p>Hereupon, <hi>Titus</hi> went to view what way he might beſt aſſault the City; and as he deviſed with himſelf, he eſpied a Plain on that ſide where the Sepulchre of <hi>Jehochanan</hi> the High Prieſt was; where he ſtayed a while, and ſent one of his Captains that were then
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46445:83"/>with him, called <hi>Nicanor,</hi> to parley with the <hi>Iews</hi> that were upon the Walls, to move them to Peace; willing him to ſay thus unto them, Friends, My Lord <hi>Titus</hi> is deſirous to ſpare you, and to make a League with you, that you might be at quiet, and out of this Danger and Deſtruction; and if you be ſo diſpoſed to conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Titus</hi> ſhall make a League with you before it be yet Night. <hi>Nicanor</hi> went and ſpake unto the People in ſuch wiſe as <hi>Titus</hi> had willed him. The <hi>Iews</hi> gave him no Word of Anſwer, but held their Peace; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nicanor</hi> ſpake to them again, and as he was talking to them, one from the Walls ſhot him with an Arrow, and killed him: whereat <hi>Titus</hi> was exceeding wroth, that they ſhould ſhoot at his Captain, offering them Peace, and his Death grieved him much. Wherefore he commanded Ladders, Brakes, Slings, battering Rams, and other Engines of War to be brought to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the Town. So the Souldiers brought a battering Ram to batter the Walls, and planted it upon a Mount accordingly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> ſeeing that were ſore afraid; wherefore, the three Seditious Captains joyned themſelves in Friendſhip, and forthwith opening the Gates, iſſued out, and beat the <hi>Romans</hi> from their Pieces and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, that were now ready addreſſed, ſetting fire on the Ram, Slings, and all the other Engines, a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which <hi>Titus</hi> and his Men ſaved from the Fire.</p>
               <p>In this Conflict the Men of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that ſerved <hi>Titus,</hi> behaved themſelves like brave men, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the Slings from the <hi>Iews:</hi> yet the <hi>Iews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and got the upper hand of them, till <hi>Titus</hi> came with a ſtrong Power of choice Men to ſuccour the <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrians,</hi> where twelve of the ſtouteſt <hi>Iews</hi> were ſlain.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Skirmiſh, <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Edomites</hi> that came to aid the <hi>Iews,</hi> was ſlain by an <hi>Arabian</hi> that came behind him and ſhot him with an Arrow while he was talking with the <hi>Romans</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46445:84"/>him to come to them, for whom the <hi>Edomites</hi> mourned and lamented; for he was a good Man of War. The next Night certain of the Seditious, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s and <hi>Schimeon</hi>'s Company, iſſued out, and came to the three wooden Towers that <hi>Titus</hi> had erected before the Walls, to view out of them the Town, and to ſee what the <hi>Jews</hi> did within, which were there placed, and without alſo a ſtrong Party of able Souldiers for their Defence; upon thoſe without fell the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſlew many; the others fled to <hi>Titus</hi>'s Camp. The <hi>Romans</hi> that were in the Towers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of the matter, and truſting to them that were ſet about the Towers for their Safeguard, ſlept all the Night. After the <hi>Jews</hi> had thus ſlain the <hi>Roman</hi>'s Watch, and put them to flight, they came to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Saws, and cut the Feet aſunder, ſo that they fell ſuddenly, together with them that were within, which were very many, and ſlew them every one. <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the Allarm, and the craſhing of the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Towers, was ſore afraid, and all the whole Army; and not knowing what the matter was, they durſt not ſtir towards it. So the <hi>Jews</hi> returned ſafe into the Town.</p>
               <p>On the morrow <hi>Titus</hi> brought his whole Power to the Walls, and while the <hi>Jews</hi> were at Contention in the Town, he addreſſed another Ram, where with he ſuddenly ſtruck the outer Wall, and battered it through. Whereupon, the People that warded that Wall were forced to withdraw themſelves within the Safeguard of the ſecond Wall: then <hi>Titus</hi> commanded his Souldiers to raze to the Ground that Wall that he had pierced, and to carry away the Stones thereof, that there ſhould be no Let nor Hinderance to his Men. This was the moſt ſubſtantial and ſtrongeſt Wall of all, thicker than both the other, and was builded by <hi>Herod:</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> labouring earneſtly in defacing of the outer Wall, were ſlain in great numbers by the <hi>Jews,</hi> from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Wall, before they could finiſh their purpoſe. The
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46445:84"/>chief of the <hi>Jews</hi> perceiving that <hi>Titus</hi> had not only taken, but alſo quite pulled down the outer Wall, and how there was now but two Walls left about the Town, it went to their Hearts, and made them look about them; therefore the Seditious began now earneſtly to think of Unity and Concord among themſelves, ſo that they divided the Town among them into three Wards. <hi>Jehochanan</hi> was appointed to that Ward that is on the North part of the Temple, beſide the <hi>Antochia;</hi> that part of the Town that was toward the Tomb of <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> the High Prieſt, was aſſigned to <hi>Schimeon;</hi> to <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer</hi> was committed the keeping the Well. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting one another to act after a couragious. Manner, did valiantly reſiſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſo that the Conflicts then began to be ſore and hard. The <hi>Romans,</hi> for their Renown and Fame, laid on ſtoutly, and the <hi>Iews</hi> again ſtruck ſtifly to their Defence, ſeeing their End at hand if they were ſlack. <hi>Titus</hi> now and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting his Souldiers to act like Men, promiſing them that would valiantly make any Enterprize upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> abundance of Gold and Silver, and much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour withall. Then ſtep'd forth one of the Souldiers, named <hi>Longinus,</hi> and put himſelf among the Routs of the <hi>Iews</hi> that were iſſued out of the Town, where he ſlew a couple of the chief of them, and preſently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf again within the Array of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhrunk not from the <hi>Romans,</hi> for they were in a fervent Rage and wonderful Diſdain; and to further their Courage, <hi>Schimeon</hi> came to his Men, and cried unto them with a loud Voice, ſaying, For the reverence of God's Friends, flee not this day; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth flee, let him be ſure he ſhall dye for it, and his Houſe be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> alſo admoniſhed his to keep their Array, and not to give back to <hi>Schimeon.</hi> Then went he himſelf to that part of the Town where <hi>Jehochanan</hi>'s Ward was, there he cauſed a battering Ram to be planted, and bent againſt the Wall, (for there was a very fair Plain.)
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46445:85"/>There was at that time in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> one called <hi>Kantor,</hi> who got him a Company of the Seditious, and ſhot from the Walls into the <hi>Romans</hi> Army, where he ſlew very many, and compelled the reſt to retire. This <hi>Kantor,</hi> vvith nine other luſty Men, whereof he vvas the <hi>Decurion,</hi> defended one part of the Town. Novv as the <hi>Romans</hi> bended the Ram to batter the Wall, <hi>Kantor</hi> cryed unto <hi>Titus,</hi> I beſeech thee, My Lord <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> be merciful unto this moſt famous City that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beaten down already, do not deface it utterly, but take Pity of the Sanctuary that is in it, and deſtroy not the Habitation of the Lord God. <hi>Titus</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt commanded his Men to ſtay, and to leave off battering the Wall. Then ſaid he to <hi>Kantor,</hi> Come forth hither to me, and thou ſhalt ſave thy ſelf; I will pardon thee, thou ſhalt not be deſtroyed. <hi>Kantor</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I will ſee if I can perſwade theſe my Fellows to come with me. But he did it upon colour, for none other cauſe, than craftily to trifle out Time, whereby he might cauſe <hi>Titus</hi> to leave off the Aſſault for a while, ſo he ſpake unto his Fellows which knew his Mind, that the <hi>Romans</hi> might hear, <hi>Let us go down and flee to the</hi> Romans <hi>Army;</hi> then they drew out their Svvords as tho they vvould kill him, and ſtriking upon his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he fell dovvn to the Ground in the ſight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> vvhich vvere ignorant of his Deceit. Then one of the <hi>Romans</hi> let fly an Arrow that wounded <hi>Kan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> upon the Face, and glancing from him ſlew another that ſtood by him. Then <hi>Kantor</hi> cried out, What do ye? Will ye ſhoot at us that deſire to be at Peace with you, which ye granted your ſelves, and now will ye break your Promiſe that ye made unto us? Is this the Revvard, My Lord <hi>Titus,</hi> that thou rendereſt me for going about to flee unto thee, that thy Souldiers ſhoot at me, hearing me require Conditions? Now therefore, My Lord, may it pleaſe thee to ſend hither ſome Man of Honour to me that I may come down and receive Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of thy Promiſe to be as one of thy own Men:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46445:85"/>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> thinking he meant good faith, ſpake unto <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> willing him to go and make peace with the <hi>Jews</hi> in his name, then to bring him unto him, that he might find ſafeguard of his life from the common Deſtruction; <hi>Joſeph</hi> anſwered, why wilt thou ſend me: what have I offended thee in? have not I ever done thee true and faithful Service; therefore if thou bear me any good will or favour, ſend me not unto him whom I cannot truſt. For <hi>Joſeph</hi> miſtruſted ſome ſubtilty, knowing <hi>Kantor</hi> afore. So <hi>Titus</hi> ſent one <hi>Jarus,</hi> who ſaid unto <hi>Kantor,</hi> come down and let us go together to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kantor</hi> deſired him to hold abroad his Cloak-lap, that he might hurle him down his Money that he had there (leſt the <hi>Jews</hi> perceiving it would take it from him) and then he would come down: and <hi>Jarus</hi> held up his lap to receive the Money that <hi>Kantor</hi> ſpake of, <hi>Kantor</hi> with all his might caſt down a great ſtone, which <hi>Jarus</hi> eſpying, leapt aſide and avoided: but it lighted upon one of his Fellows, and ſlew him. <hi>Titus</hi> was wonderful wroth at this, and forthwith planted yet another Ram againſt the Walls, and at length laid it flat upon the gronnd.</p>
               <p>Then commanded <hi>Titus</hi> to make Fires about the Walls, where the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould think to eſcape: <hi>Kantor</hi> ſeeing that, would have fled, and as he made haſte to eſcape the Fires, the weight of his Armour bare him down into the Fire, and there he died, more deſirous of death than life.</p>
               <p>Then entred the <hi>Romans</hi> within the ſecond Wall, againſt whom the Seditious iſſued, and fought with ſuch vehement force, that they prevailed againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſlew many of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and forced the reſt to retire unto the firſt Wall that they had beaten down before.</p>
               <p>In this Skirmſh <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf took a Bow, and ſhot at the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that not one of his Arrows were ſpent in vain, but that it did ſome annoyance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46445:86"/>to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> notwithſtanding gave them the Repulſe from the Town, and they were not able to make their Party good with them. Within four days after came unto <hi>Titus</hi> a new ſupply of Souldiers, out of all Quarters, for aid to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whoſe help they prevailed againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> at ſuch time as they iſſued out of the Town, and conſtrained them to withdraw themſelves within the Walls.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Titus</hi> pittying the miſerable ſtate of the City, Temple, and the People of the Lord, at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his People to withdraw themſelves from the Walls, and to leave off the Aſſault for a while, that he might offer Peace to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſee if they would be now content to ſubmit themſelves unto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> to have quietneſs and reſt without danger of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Wherefore he gave them Truce for five days: and upon the fifth day he came to the Gate of the City, where he eſpyed <hi>Schimeon</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan</hi> together preparing Fire to deſtroy the <hi>Roman</hi> Engines of War: for all the <hi>Iews</hi> had agreed together with one mind ſtill to withſtand the <hi>Romans.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Iews</hi> to be ſo deſperately bent, that they had even vowed their Lives to Death, he began to offer and propoſe unto them conditions of Peace, and ſharply to reprove and blame their obſtinate Stubborneſs, ſaying, I have won two of your Walls, and ye have but one left: therefore, if ye will continue ſtill in this ſelf-will'd frowardneſs, what will you do (moſt miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) when as I ſhall alſo gain the third Wall and quite deſtroy your City, pulling down the Temple and all? why do you not rather favour and ſpare your own lives, your Wives and Children? but the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſet upon a ſullen Obſtinacy, would in no wiſe hear <hi>Titus</hi> ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Titus</hi> ſent <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to declare his mind unto them in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that they might ſafely credit his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the Peace that was offered, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> therefore went and ſtood over againſt the Gate, keeping himſelf a loof off, for he was afraid to come nigh the Wall,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46445:86"/>knowing that the People hated him, becauſe he had yielded himſelf to the <hi>Romans;</hi> he called therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them aloud and told them in a very pathetick ſpeech, the whole Hiſtory of all former diſtreſſes and ſufferings of their Nation, and what perpetual Calamities this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of theirs might bring upon them. But the return they made to all his good Counſel and advice was gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Teeth, hurling of Stones and Darts at him from the Walls to have killed him; whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebuke them, and repreſented to them, with all the tenderneſs imaginable, how fatal this Stubborneſs of theirs would prove to them, and he did it to that purpoſe, that the People hearing him, wept wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for they could have been content to have followed his advice. At this time <hi>Titus</hi> gave command unto all the <hi>Romans,</hi> to ſend again the <hi>Iews</hi> that were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and Slaves into the City: by which means he ſtrikes from himſelf the Blood of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and laid it upon the Necks of their Maſters, for <hi>Titus</hi> took pitty of them thorough <hi>Ioſeph</hi>'s Oration and good Counſel. The common People of the <hi>Iews</hi> deſired nothing more than to have come forth, and fall to agreement, to make peace with <hi>Titus;</hi> but <hi>Schimeon, Eleazer,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan,</hi> Captains over the Seditious, ſet ſtrong Watch and Ward at every Gate, charging them to kill all that ſhould go forth. Thus were many killed which would have fled forth to <hi>Titus,</hi> and the City of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was cloſed up, and no man could get out or in. In the mean ſeaſon fell a great Dearth and Famine in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> inſomuch that the Seditious ſearched every mans houſe and Cellar for Food.</p>
               <p>And becauſe a certain Houſholder withſtood them they killed him: thus they dealt with all them that dwelled in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till the Victuals in the Town was all ſpent, that Men began to ſeek Dung, and even Man's Excrements, to eat; by which means, much of the People died for Hunger. Whoſoever at that time could get any Herbs or Roots, Mice, Serpents, or other creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46445:87"/>Worms (whatſoever they were) to eat, he was counted happy, becauſe he had found Meat to ſuſtain and ſave his Life withal in that hard Famine and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hunger. Moreover, Whoſoever had any Corn in ſtore, that no man knew of, he was afraid to ſend it to the Mill, or bake it, becauſe of the Wickedneſs of the Seditious, leſt they ſhould take away from them their Suſtenance; wherefore many did eat the dry Corn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground in their Cellars privily.</p>
               <p>At that time alſo were many exceeding rich Men in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who ſtole Meat from each other; ſo that the Father ſnatched Meat from the Son, and the Son from the Father; the Mother ſnatch'd from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Children likewiſe from their Mother; and ſuch as fled out of the Gates, or otherwiſe, let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down over the Walls in the night Seaſon; who being ſuſpected to be the Seditious Perſons, the <hi>Romans</hi> killed them without. This Evil therefore and Diſtreſs encreaſed ſo long, that the People had devoured all that ever crept on the Earth, from the Mouſe to the Spider, from the Nevvt to the Weeſel, whereby a moſt grievous Peſtilence followed, that innumerable of the People of the Land died, and there was no Man to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them.</p>
               <p>When they chanced to find any dead Horſe or other Beaſt in the Town, a Man ſhould ſee many <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtrive and fight for it; in all Points like to famiſhed Ravens lighting upon a dead Carcaſs, ſo that in ſuch Contentions very many were ſlain. Therefore, when divers Men, with their Wives and Children, got out of the City to gather Herbs to eat, and chanced among the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> laid hold on the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and killed them; ſaying, we will diſpatch theſe, leſt when they grow once to mans Eſtate, they make War upon us as their Fathers do at this day. So many as came out of the Gates of the City now and then the <hi>Romans</hi> killed and hanged them upon Gallowes, over againſt the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the number of five
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46445:87"/>hundred: After the ſame manner, <hi>Schimeon, Iehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Eleazer</hi> dealt with thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> whom they could by any Train catch, and hanged them upon the Walls. Whoſoever alſo they could perceive would flee unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> they hanged them likewiſe over the Walls, to the number of five hundred. But <hi>Titus</hi> gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all his Souldiers, that no man upon pain of Death ſhould kill any of them that fled out of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for he took pitty of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ceaſed to ſpeak friendly and lovingly to the <hi>Ieruſalemites;</hi> ſo that he went once again to the Walls, and ſpake unto the <hi>Iews</hi> in this ſort.</p>
               <p>Hear I beſeech you the Counſel of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and come unto me that you may live, and not periſh utterly. Spare your People: why will you oppreſs them, vexed with hunger, thirſt, peſtilence, and beſieging? But the Seditious hearing <hi>Titus</hi> ſpeak, were wonderfully incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and intended to add miſchief upon miſchief, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yet more cruelly the People of God. Moreover, they rail'd at <hi>Titus,</hi> to provoke him to anger, that he might leave off ſpeaking to the People, which had now almoſt loſt their obedience and fear of the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Seditious ſpake unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> It is better for us to die with Hunger, and to be killed in this affliction, ſo to come to the Bliſs and Light we hope for, than to live and ſee the moſt holy Temple of God defiled and deſtroyed. When <hi>Titus</hi> ſaw this he commanded an Iron Ram to be ſet to the Wall to batter it, that he might deliver thoſe poor wretches out of <hi>Schimeon, Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Iehochanan</hi>'s hands, who held them in as Captives.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time as they erected that Engine to the Wall, it happened there was in the Camp a certain young man whoſe name was <hi>Meriganin,</hi> Son of <hi>Antiochus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> one of the Kings of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who came at <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s command to aid <hi>Titus.</hi> This ſame young man was very ſwift, a good Runner, and a hardy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46445:88"/>Souldiers, but he lacked Diſcretion. He came to <hi>Titus,</hi> and ſaid, I cannot but marvel at thy Souldiers that vanquiſh all Nations and dare not ſet upon the <hi>Iews</hi> to kill them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the young King ſay ſo, ſmiled, and ſaid; How chances it, that being of this Judgment, thou arm'ſt not thy ſelf, and makeſt thee ready to do like as thou ſayeſt; why draweſt thou not out thy Sword to declare thy man-hood upon them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the young King incouraged himſelf, and called together all his <hi>Macedonian</hi> Souldiers, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and began Skirmiſh with them, ſhooting with their Bows and Arrows apace. But at length the <hi>Iews</hi> handled them, that not one of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> eſcaped, ſave only the young King, which by his good footmanſhip and ſwift running, got away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Memaganin</hi> was of the kindred of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who had the Dominion of the whole World, and when all Nations and People ſtood in awe of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> the Prieſt demanded of him whoſe Son he was; he anſwered, <hi>I came of the ſeed of</hi> Alexander, <hi>I am the tenth from him. Ioſeph</hi> ſaid, it may well be as thou haſt ſaid, that thou art of the ſucceſſion of <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the valiantneſs of thy heart which thou haſt ſhow'd declareth no leſs. Howbeit thou ſhalt underſtand, that the <hi>Romans</hi> have done wiſely to abſtain from the aſſault at this time, becauſe they knew they ſhould have to do with a moſt valiant Nation, which thou having ſo well tryed, mayeſt report and teſtifie when thou art asked the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Titus</hi> divided his whole Army, and laid them privily in ambuſhes round about the Walls. He prepared moreover Rams of Iron to batter the Walls. Of theſe four, one he planted upon the ſide of the place called <hi>Antochia,</hi> the Engine was thirty Cubits long. The ſame night, Captain <hi>Iehochanan</hi> with his Company iſſued forth, and undermined the ground, under the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46445:88"/>Wheels of the Waggons that bare the Rams, putting pitched Boards, oyled, and done over with Brimſtone, in the Trenches under the wheels; and under the Boards they ſpread Leather, which likewiſe was ſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and done over with Pitch, Oyl, and Brimſtone.</p>
               <p>Then they ſet fire upon the Boards, which burn'd till they came to the feet of the Rams; and they being ſet on Fire and burn'd, the Engine fell upon the Watch that was appointed to keep it, being aſleep, and killed them: whereat the <hi>Romans</hi> were diſmayed, and ſaid, It is not poſſible we ſhould aſſault this City here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for they have burn'd all our Engines of War, wherewith we have ſubdued all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; ſo that now of fifty Iron Rams we brought with us, we have but ſix left, and the Seditious <hi>Jews</hi> have burn'd three of them, What ſhall we now do? Hovv ſhall vve batter the Walls hereafter? The <hi>Jews</hi> upon the Walls hearing their Words, flouted them, and laughed them to ſcorn; Wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> incenſed vvith Anger, commanded the other three Rams to be addreſſed in the place of thoſe vvhich vvere burn'd. In the mean ſeaſon, vvhile the <hi>Romans</hi> were at work, four young men, moved with great Zeal, whoſe names were, firſt <hi>Theopatius Galileus,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Magarus Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bronitu,</hi> the third <hi>Jorminas Schomronitu,</hi> the fourth <hi>Arius Jeroſolymita.</hi> Theſe, all armed, iſſued out into the Camp of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that then ſtood about their three Engines and Iron Rams, deviſing how to batter the Walls of the City, ſome of whom theſe Men killed, the other fled. Then two of them ſtood at Defence, to keep off all thoſe that approached nigh the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, while the other tvvo, <hi>Jeroſolymitanus</hi> and <hi>Schomronitu</hi> daubed the Timber with a certain matter which they had prepared to make it take fire, and ſtraightway ſet fire on them; ſo that ſuddenly the Rams were on a light fire: then they all four joyning together withſtood the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they ſhould not come at the Engines to quench the Fire. Shortly the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46445:89"/>Rams fell down, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtood aloof, hurling Stones, and ſhooting thick at them; for they were afraid to come nigh them, becauſe of their great fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although they were three thouſand Men that kept the Rams; yet theſe four ſet nothing by them, nor yet ever went off the Ground till the Rams were clean burnt up, though the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhot never ſo thick at them. <hi>Titus</hi> hearing the Valiantneſs of theſe Young Men, and the Harms they had done unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> made ſpeed with his whole Hoſt to ſave the Rams from the fire, and to apprehend thoſe Young Men. Then forthwith iſſued out <hi>Schimeon, Jehochanan,</hi> and <hi>Eleazer,</hi> Captains of the Seditious, with their Souldiers, ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Trumpets, and made the <hi>Romans</hi> retire, that they could not come nigh the Fire, and ſo reſcued the four Young Men from the <hi>Romans</hi> that had environed them round about.</p>
               <p>In that Skirmiſh were killed ten thouſand and five hundred Men. Then gathered together all the whole Army of the <hi>Romans</hi> to aſſault the <hi>Iews</hi> at once, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching hard to the Walls of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where they cryed unto the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſaying, What, are you Oxen or Goats, that you fight on this Faſhion upon the Walls? Will you be taken in the midſt of the City, like as Oxen or Goats are taken in their Folds? If ye be men, come forth, and let us try our Manhood here in this Plain. But you by ſtealth and unawares ſet upon them that keep our Engines, ſnatching them up like as they were Wolves ſhould ſnatch Sheep, then run away into the Town as the Wolves run into the Wood. If there be any Manhood in you, behold we are ready here, come forth to us, ſo many for ſo many, and then we ſhall ſee what end vvill come thereof. When the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Seditious heard that, they ſpake unto the Warriours that vvere in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Which of you vvill go out vvith us to thoſe Dogs, to ſhevv our Force and Stomach for the Sanctuary and City of the Lord? Then five hundred tall Fellovvs of their ovvn Accord, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46445:89"/>out upon the <hi>Roman</hi>'s ſuddenly, and ſlevv eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, and compelled the reſt to retreat from the Walls, The <hi>Romans</hi> then felt vvhat Valiantneſs the <hi>Iews</hi> had; for the <hi>Romans</hi> vvere in number forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting Men, and the <hi>Iews</hi> vvere only five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, vvhereof not one of them vvas killed at that Skirmiſh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> afar off ſhot at the <hi>Iews,</hi> and hurled Stones, to vvhom the <hi>Iews</hi> ſaid, Come hither to us; are you not they who called us forth, and provoked us to come to you? Why come you not now nearer? You go about to drive us away with Arrows and Stones. What, Do you think us to be Dogs, and that we are afraid of your Stones? Are we not Men? Yea, we are of your Maſters and Betters, for you run away from us as Servants flee from their Maſters when they follow them to beat them. <hi>Titus</hi> ſeeing his Army to be part of them fled, and part to be ſlain, he cried to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>Is it not a ſhame for you, ye</hi> Romans, <hi>and a wonderful great Diſhonour, to flee from the</hi> Jews, <hi>ſo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-beaten, famiſhed, almost dead for Thirst, and beſieged? Alas! How ſhall ye put away this Rebuke and Ignominy, when as all Nations whom ye have heretofore valiantly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ſhall hear that ye flee from theſe dead</hi> Jews, <hi>whoſe whole Land we have in poſſeſſion, ſo that they have nothing left but this only Town, which we have ſo battered that they have but one only Wall to defend themſelves. Beſides this, they are very few, we are innumerable; they have no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to aid them, we have help of all Lands: Why then do you flee from their ſight, like as ſmall impotent Birds flee from the Eagle? What though the</hi> Jews <hi>vow and hazard themſelves deſperately for their Temple and Land, why do you not the ſame alſo in theſe Wars, to get you a Renown of Valiantneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> prevailed that day, and had the upper hand: wherefore they returned into the Town with great Glory, having put the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſo great a foil. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> commanded his men to addreſs and prepare the other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46445:90"/>two Rams that were left, to batter the Walls of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> withal; wherefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Carpenters caſt a Trench, to prepare and ſet up the Rams, in ſuch places as <hi>Titus</hi> had aſſigned them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were aware of it well enough, but winked at that matter as yet, untill they had planted the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-beams between the ſtanding Poſts: ſo when the Work was finiſhed, even to the hanging up of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines betwixt the ſtanding Poſts, to ſhake the Wall withall, the <hi>Romans</hi> being ſecure and void of Care, nothing miſtruſting that the <hi>Jews</hi> would ſtir, becauſe they had been quiet a few Nights, and never iſſued forth of the City, upon a certain Night, a pretty while before day, the three principal Captains of the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous came and laid their Heads together, to deviſe what they ſhould do. <hi>Eleazer</hi> gave this Counſel, and ſaid, You two the laſt time burn'd the Rams, and got you Renown, and I kept the Gates the while; Now keep ye the Gates, and I will iſſue out with my Men againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> to get me Fame alſo,</p>
               <p>The other anſwered, Go then on God's name unto them, the Lord God of the Sanctuary which is in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> ſhall be preſent with thee, but beware thou be not ſlain, and in any wiſe thou be not taken alive: to whom he anſwer'd, The Lord God ſhall keep me, for upon the truſt of the Righteouſneſs of my Father <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> the High Prieſt, and his ſincere Service unto God, I will ſet upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazer</hi> therefore choſe a hundred valiant Souldiers, and with them he iſſued out of the Town before day: the ſame Night the <hi>Romans</hi> had made Fires about their Engines where they watched becauſe of the Cold; the Artificers and Souldiers that kept the Ward and the Watch about the <hi>Romans,</hi> were a hundred and fifty. The day was the twenty ſeventh of the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> which was the ninth Month that <hi>Titus</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Ieruſalem, Eleazer</hi> and his Company thus being iſſued out, came and found ſome of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſnort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46445:90"/>about the Fires, others watching in their Wards, and killed them all, that not one remained. Then ſome of <hi>Eleazer</hi>'s Company ſet fire upon the Rams, burn'd the ſtanding Poſts, Ropes, Chains, and other Inſtruments of War; the Artificers that were there they apprehended alive, and burn'd them, ſo that not one Man eſcaped.</p>
               <p>When it was day <hi>Titus</hi> obſerved the ſmoak of the Fire mounted up very foul, and ſtinking of the Wood and Men together; he drew towards the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with his Hoſt to ſee what the matter was: <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> in the mean Seaſon, and his Companions, took, as they might get, every man a piece of the Engines out of the Fire, or ſome of their Heads that they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and returned with great Joy, flouting the <hi>Romans,</hi> and laughing them to ſcorn by the way, till they came to the Gates of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where they were received of <hi>Schimeon</hi> and <hi>Jehochanan</hi> with great Honour.</p>
               <p>Soon after this came many Souldiers and great bands of Men out of all Nations, that were ſubject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to aid <hi>Titus;</hi> to whom <hi>Titus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what hapned him in that Siege. The Stoutneſs of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and how they had annoyed many vvays the <hi>Roman</hi> Army; adding moreover, and aſking them, Did you ever ſee four Men withſtand ten thouſand and five hundred, ſo that they being all together, could neither overthrow them nor take them Priſoners; but the four ſlew them like as it had been the tops of Cucumbers ſmitten off with moſt ſharp Swords? When they heard this, they vvondred all very much. Then <hi>Titus</hi> ſpake unto his Hoſt, and them who were newly repaired unto him, to ſhew their Advice and beſt Counſel what was to be done, leſt we ſhould be aſhamed, ſaid he, before all them that ſhall hereafter hear of our Wars.</p>
               <p>The graveſt and moſt ancient of the Nations which vvere nevvly come to his Aid, anſvvered, If it pleaſe Your Majeſty, let the <hi>Romans</hi> breath a vvhile, and take their Reſt, vvhich are novv vvearied vvith the ſundry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46445:91"/>Battels of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and we, who are not ſo broken with labour, but freſh and luſty, ſhall try what the <hi>Iews</hi> can do, we cannot think that they are able to withſtand ſo great a multitude.</p>
               <p>But the Princes of the <hi>Romans</hi> deſired <hi>Titus</hi> that he ſhould not permit them this, leſt he ſhould increaſe their own ſorrows, if peradventure they ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited (ſaid they) by the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down'd unto their own ſhame: for if we who are acquainted with their Stratagems, and know their manner of fighting, cannot ſuſtain their violence, how ſhall they do it that never had proof of the force and ſtrength of the <hi>Iews?</hi> they ſhall be to them like hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop which grows upon the Walls, in compariſon of the Cedar Trees of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The others ſaid nay, they ſhould do well enough with them. And they urged <hi>Titus</hi> ſo inſtantly that they conſtrained him to grant their deſires. Then <hi>Titus</hi> gave them leave to ſet upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> thinking with himſelf, peradventure the <hi>Jews</hi> may be put to the worſt by theſe men, who will fight without fear, not knowing the force of the <hi>Jews:</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> that have had tryal of their ſtrength fight fearfully and warily. So the Lords of the ſtrange Nations, choſe out of their Army eighty thouſand men; ten thouſand <hi>Macedonians,</hi> twenty thouſand <hi>Brittains,</hi> five thouſand <hi>Aramites,</hi> ten thouſand <hi>Africans,</hi> ten thouſand valiant <hi>Burgundians,</hi> five thouſand <hi>Redarans;</hi> laſt of all ten thouſand <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> Theſe therefore went into the Plain which is by the Sepulchre of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> the High-Prieſt, and from thence made an Aſſault upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that were upon the Walls, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up their ſcaling Ladders. <hi>Jehochanan</hi> ſaid to <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Eleazer,</hi> his two companions; if you think good I will iſſue forth, and Skirmiſh with theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, to let them ſee what I can do; <hi>Schimeon</hi> anſwered, let two of us do it, and the third keep the Gates and the Walls; for thou alone art able to do
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46445:91"/>nothing againſt them, they are ſo many. <hi>Eleazer</hi> allowed this advice, offering himſelf to bear <hi>Jehochanan</hi> company. <hi>Schimeon</hi> bad them go, ſaying, the Lord of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary give them into your hands, and deal not with you at this time according to your Works.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Iehochanan</hi> and <hi>Eleazer</hi> ſallied out with one thouſand five hundred good men of War, the ninth day of the Month <hi>Tebeth,</hi> which was the tenth Month that <hi>Titus</hi> had beſieged <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and overthrew of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of that Hoſt, fifty ſeven thouſand and five hundred men, beſides three thouſand whom they took Priſoners: but of the <hi>Iews</hi> were no more ſlam in that Fight than only ſeven, whoſe Bodies with much rejoycing and great Triumph they carried with them into the Town, and buried them there, leſt peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the uncircumciſed ſhould have miſordered them. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were left with great ſhame and diſhonour returned unto <hi>Titus,</hi> who reprehended them becauſe they would not believe the <hi>Romans.</hi> The next day following, the <hi>Iews</hi> brought forth the three thouſand Nobles and Gentlemen that they had taken Priſoners, and plucked out of every one of them an Eye, and out off every man the one hand, after ſent them back with ſhame and reproach to <hi>Titus</hi>'s Camp.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Titus</hi> conſulted with all his Princes what they were beſt to do with the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> and when every man had ſaid his mind, he liked never a mans Counſel, but ſaid unto them, Well, I have deviſed this with my ſelf, which I will follow, and no man ſhall bring me from my purpoſe: we will keep the Siege without any Aſſault or Skirmiſh, for their Victuals fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them long ago, and ſo they ſhall be famiſhed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, when they ſhall ſee us ceaſe to fight with them, they will fall at variance amongſt themſelves, and kill one another.</p>
               <p>This Counſel was thought good of all <hi>Titus</hi>'s Princes, wherefore they beſieged the Town, as <hi>Titus</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and cloſed up all the waies of the City round
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46445:92"/>about, leſt the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhould, as they had done before, come upon them unawares. They appointed more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Watch Day and Night, to take heed that no man ſhould come out of the Town to gather Herbs for their ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>Then increaſed the hunger in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which if it had not been ſo grievous, the City had never been won: for the Souldiers of the Town are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Eagles, and fiercer than Lyons. There died therefore of the Famin a wonderful many of the <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalemites,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Iews</hi> could not find place to bury them in they were ſo many in every place of the Town. Many caſt their dead folks into their Wells, and tumbled afterwards in themſelves and died. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo made themſelves Graves, and went into them alive, where they tarried Day and Night and died, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourned for, for all mourning and accuſtomed lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the dead was left off, becauſe of the unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Famin, which was ſo great, that it cannot be told, and I cannot relate the thouſandth part of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that followed of the hunger. <hi>Titus,</hi> ſeeing the innumerable Carkaſſes; of the dead, that were caſt into the Brook <hi>Cedron</hi> like dung, was wonderfully amazed with fear.</p>
               <p>At that time certain wicked Perſons of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſlandered <hi>Amittai</hi> the Prieſt falſly, ſaying to Captain <hi>Schimeon,</hi> Behold, <hi>Amittai</hi> the High-Prieſt, who did let thee into the City, goeth about to flee to the Tents of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thou haſt Experience of his great Wit and Wiſdom, hovv he alſo knoweth the ſecret ways into the Tovvn, Temple, and Sanctuary, and who can tell vvhether he vvill bring the <hi>Romans</hi> ſome Night at Mid-night into the City? therefore <hi>Schimeon</hi> ſent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons to fetch <hi>Amittai</hi> and his four Sons unto him.</p>
               <p>They that vvere ſent, brought <hi>Amittai</hi> and but three Sons, for one vvas fled to the <hi>Romans</hi> and come to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> When <hi>Amittai</hi> and the others vvere brought
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46445:92"/>to <hi>Schimeon</hi>'s Preſence, he beſought him he might not live, but be put to death immediately, leſt (ſaid he) I ſhould live to ſee the death of my Children. But <hi>Schimeon</hi> was hard-hearted, and would not be intreated; for it was God's Will that <hi>Amittai</hi> ſhould be puniſhed, becauſe he was the Bringer of <hi>Schimeon</hi> into <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore fell he into his Hands, which for good rewarded him with evil. <hi>Schimeon</hi> commanded a ſort of Murderers to place <hi>Amittai</hi> upon the Walls, in the ſight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſaid unto him, See'ſt thou <hi>Amittai?</hi> Why do not the <hi>Romans</hi> deliver and reſcue thee out of my Hand? Thee, I ſay, who would'ſt have fled unto them? <hi>Amittai</hi> anſwered nothing to this, but ſtill beſought him before his Death, he might kiſs his Sons, and bid them farewel: but <hi>Schimeon</hi> utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him his Requeſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Amittai</hi> vvept aloud, ſaying to his Sons, I brought (Dear Children) this Thief into this Tovvn, vvherefore I am counted novv for a Thief my ſelf; all the Miſchief vvhich is come upon me and you, it is mine ovvn doing, becauſe I have brought this ſeditious Villain into this Holy City: I thought then, peradventure he vvill be a help to the Tovvn, but it is proved contrary; for he has been a moſt cruel Enemy to the ſame. It was not enough for us to keep one ſeditious Perſon, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hochanan</hi> I mean, who took unto him <hi>Eleazer,</hi> the firſt beginner of Sedition, but I muſt bring in alſo this wicked <hi>Schimeon,</hi> who conſpires with our Foes to our Deſtruction. Indeed I never brought him in for any Love I bear unto him, but all the Prieſts and the whole Multitude of the People, ſent me to fetch him; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I am worthy of this Judgment of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I took upon me ſuch an Embaſſage.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeak of thee, thou moſt wicked <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon?</hi> for whitherſoever thou turneſt thee thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things out of frame: I indeed, thou dealeſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with me, becauſe I have ſinned unto God, to his People, and his City, in that I have brought thee in to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46445:93"/>be a Plague to it, wherefore I am worthy to be ſtoned, notwithſtanding it had been thy part, thou wicked Murderer, to deliver me and my Sons from the hands of the other Seditious, for I have done good: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, our God will not alter nor change his Judgment, which is, that I ſhould fall into the Sword of thy hand, for that I made thee to enter into this City, wherein I offended God grievouſly. If I had purpoſed to flee unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> could not I have done it before I brought in thee? For at that time beared'ſt thou no Rule over us; and before we called in thee, <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> with his Sedition was an offence to this City; wherefore we perſwaded all the Ancients of the Town that thou ſhould'ſt be an Aid unto us, to drive out our Foes; but thou, in whom we put our truſt, art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Enemy; yea thou haſt been worſe than they, for the other put Men to death privily, but thou doſt it openly. Who is he that hath ſtrengthned the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Romans?</hi> Art not thou he who killed the Souldiers of God in the midſt of the City of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> For, few have been ſlain without. <hi>Titus</hi> would have made Peace with us, taking pity upon us, but thou did'ſt let and hinder it, every day moving new Wars, and ſtirring new Battels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> gave charge to his Souldiers, to lay no hand upon the Temple; but thou haſt defiled and polluted the Temple of the Lord, ſhedding Blood without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in the midſt thereof. <hi>Titus</hi> went back from us from the holy-day of the Lord, and ſo <hi>Amittai</hi> went on in a very pathetick and touching Harangue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt the Cruelty of the Seditious, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating his Sons to ſuffer patiently; after which, <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> gave Commandment to four Cut-throats of his, that three of them ſhould kill <hi>Amittai</hi>'s three Sons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Father's Face, and the fourth ſhould kill <hi>Amittai</hi> himſelf, and ſo the blood of the Sons was mix'd with the blood of their Father. Afterwards <hi>Schimeon</hi>'s Servant took the Body of <hi>Amittai,</hi> and laid it upon the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46445:93"/>Bodies of his Sons, as his Deſire was, then tumbled them over the Walls: after that, <hi>Schimeon</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Chanachus</hi> the High Prieſt ſhould be put to Death, whoſe Body was caſt to the Bodies of <hi>Amittai</hi> and his Sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtus</hi> alſo the Scribe, one of the Noble-men of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> was killed at the ſame time, and ten juſt Men more of his Kindred and Houſe, becauſe they mourned for the Death of <hi>Ariſtus.</hi> It happened, while <hi>Schimeon</hi> was killing of thoſe Men, certain ſubſtantial rich Men paſſed by, and were wonderfully amazed when they ſaw the thing, ſaying one to another, How long will God ſuffer the Malice of <hi>Schimeon,</hi> and will not ſearch out the Blood of juſt Men, nor revenge them? Certain ſeditious Perſons hearing this, told it unto <hi>Schimeon,</hi> who commanded them to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and murthered the ſame day.</p>
               <p>After this, there paſſed by eleven of the Noble-men of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſeeing forty two Innocents put to death by <hi>Schimeon,</hi> they lift up their Eyes to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and ſaid,
<q>O Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> How long wilt thou hold thy hand, and not execute Anger againſt theſe Tranſgreſſors of thy Will?</q> Which when <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> heard of, he commanded them to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and killed them with his own hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazer,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ananias</hi> the Prieſt, ſeeing the Malice and Wickedneſs of <hi>Schimeon</hi> to be great, and that he deſtroyed the juſt and godly Men of the City, and that there was no hope left, he betook himſelf to the Tower of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> remained in it, and kept it with his. <hi>Jehudas</hi> alſo, a Captain over a thouſand men, which kept a Turret that <hi>Schimeon</hi> had made to put juſt and good Men in, got him up upon the top of the Walls, and cried to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if peradventure they would deliver him, and the reſt that were at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Wherefore he went about to eſcape with his own thouſand men that he had with him, and came towards the <hi>Romans.</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> truſted them not, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46445:94"/>he had ſpoken this for Deceit, vvherefore they came not to help him. <hi>Schimeon</hi> upon this killed <hi>Jehu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and the thouſand men vvhich he had with him, and commanded their Bodies to be tumbled over the Walls, in the ſight of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Schimeon</hi> cried to the Princes and Captains of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaying: Lo, theſe are <hi>Jehudas</hi> Company, theſe vvould have come forth unto you, take their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes to you, and revive them again if you can, or elſe deliver the reſt vvhich yet live out of our hands.</p>
               <p>There vvere certain Men of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at that time that came to the Gates, overcame the Wards, and got out vvith their Wives and Children, and ſo eſcaped to the <hi>Romans</hi> becauſe they could no longer abide the Famin, and the iniquity of the Seditious. They were faithful Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and of great Authority; vvhom vvhen <hi>Ioſeph</hi> heard of, he ſo prevailed, that <hi>Titus</hi> ſpared them and received them to mercy,</p>
               <p>For <hi>Ioſeph</hi> bare vvitneſs, and reported of them that they vvere Noblemen of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> vvherefore the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> received them, and gave them Food and Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but certain of them could not brook nor take it, becauſe of their great Hunger, vvherevvith they had been long pined, and vvhen the Meat deſcended dovvn into their Bellies they died ſtreight. Their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children alſo, vvhen they ſavv Bread, they fell upon it, and received it indeed vvith their Teeth, but they vvere not able to chevv it, and died holding the Bread betvveen their Teeth, Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> vvhich eſcaped thus out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Camps of the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſvvallovved their Gold and Silver, and precious Stones, to hide them, leſt they ſhould be found by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>There was a certain Scribe of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at that time, a faithful Man, whoſe Name was <hi>Menachen,</hi> Son of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruke</hi> the Scribe, of worthy Memory in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and being a Keeper of the Eaſt-gate which was in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> upon that ſide towards the Brook <hi>Kidron,</hi> noted the number of the dead that were carried forth to burying by that Gate, and found that they came to a hundred and fifteen thouſand eight hundred and eight Perſons, which were all of the Nobles and Gentlemen, or at leaſt, of the ſubſtantialleſt Men of the <hi>Iews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> upon a time (<hi>Ioſeph</hi> being preſent) asked the queſtion of thoſe Princes of the <hi>Iews</hi> which were fled unto him, ſaying, I charge you upon your ſidelity, to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46445:96"/>ſhew me how many <hi>Iews,</hi> ſince the time I beſieged you unto this day, have died. They gave him the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore, every Man as far as they knew of the dead that were carried forth at all the Gates to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the Sum amounted to ſeven hundred thouſand five hundred ſeventy five, beſides them that every where lay dead in their Houſes and Streets; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them alſo that were ſlain in the Temple, and they that lay here and there unburied: which, when <hi>Titus</hi> heard, he marvelled greatly, and ſaid, It is well known to the Lord God of Heaven, that I am not the cauſe of theſe Evils; for I deſired to be at Peace with them oftner than once, but the Seditious evermore would have nothing but War.</p>
               <p>At the time the Hunger began to wax very great in the Town amongſt the Seditious, who never lack'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for they took it always from other Men by force, till now at length they were diſtreſſed with Hunger themſelves, ſo that after they had eaten up all their Horſes, they eat alſo their Dung, and the Leather of their Chariots; neither were there left any green Boughs on their Trees, nor any Herbs that the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous might get to eat; For, the <hi>Romans</hi> had hewen down all the Trees, and cut down all the Buſhes from about <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the ſpace of thirteen miles; ſo that the whole Field and Territory of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was ſpoiled, which heretofore was repleniſhed with marvellous goodly Gardens, and moſt pleaſant Paradices.</p>
               <p>After that, the <hi>Romans</hi> made up another iron Ram, very terrible; this they bended againſt the Walls, to ſee if there were any Souldiers left in the Town ſo ſtout as they were in times paſt. When the Captains of the Seditious ſaw that, they iſſued out with their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſlew very many of them in that Skirmiſh: wherefore <hi>Titus</hi> ſaid, It is not Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to fight with them any more, but rather with the Rams to ſhake and batter the Wall; for they have no more but this Wall left, and ſo we may bring our
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46445:96"/>whole Army at once upon them, and ſubdue the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>But the Captains of the Seditious miſtruſting what the <hi>Romans</hi> intended, began to build a Countermure within, over againſt the place where the <hi>Romans</hi> wrought with their Ram. And now the <hi>Romans</hi> began moſt earneſtly to ſet upon the Wall, and make a Battery, ſo as that they ſuddenly beat down a great part of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Wall which the <hi>Jews</hi> had newly erected, and gave a great Shout, ſaying, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is won, we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Town. But, when they looked a little further, they ſaw another Fort raiſed over againſt the Breach; wherefore the <hi>Jews</hi> thorough the Town gave alſo a great Shout, and ſounded their Trumpets, rejoycing that they had another new Countermure for that which was broken down. The ſame was in Captain <hi>Jehocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>'s Ward. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing the Countermure, and hearing the <hi>Jews</hi> make ſuch Triumphs in the Town, were much aſtoniſhed, all their Joy was daſhed, and turned into Damps; ſo that they could not tell what they ſhould do with that ſtubborn People of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which had done them ſuch Damages. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſet upon the Town again another way; when <hi>Titus</hi> willed to remove the Engine, and to bend it to the new Wall whiles it was yet green and unſetled, ſaying, Let us bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and we ſhall ſee it fall by and by, and then ſhall we enter into the Town. The <hi>Roman</hi> Captains follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not <hi>Titus</hi> his Counſel, but ſcaled the Walls which they had battered. The <hi>Jews</hi> therefore deſcending the Countermure, fought with the <hi>Romans</hi> within the Breach, repulſed them from the Wall and the Town; and ſo having abated much the Strength of the <hi>Romans,</hi> returned to their Quarters.</p>
               <p>Then ſaid ſome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> We will never beſiege this Town any longer, for we ſhall not be able to get it while we live: whereupon, <hi>Titus</hi> aſſembled all his Army, and in a very pathetick Oration re-encouraged the Hearts of his Men. After which, a certain valiant
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46445:97"/>man, named <hi>Sabianus,</hi> ſaid unto his Companions, who ſo dare go to aſſault the <hi>Jews,</hi> let him come hither to me, that he may fulfill the Command of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Son, our Lord and Captain: and forthwith he took his Targe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and his drawn Sword in his Hand, made toward the Town with eleven tall Fellows following him, whoſe Valiantneſs and Courage <hi>Titus</hi> wondered at greatly.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Iews</hi> ſaw <hi>Sabianus</hi> and his Company draw faſt towards them, they began to aſſail them with Stones and Arrows; but <hi>Sabianus</hi> ſetting light of them, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged home upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> Shortly, one of the <hi>Iews</hi> met with him, and gave him ſuch a Blow that he felled him to the ground, yet he got up again, and fought for all that manſully: and as one that had rather leave his Life than the Reputation of his Valour, he did fight till another <hi>Iſraelite</hi> came and ſlew him out-right. Now other <hi>Romans</hi> ſeeing <hi>Sabianus</hi> his Act, and ſtudying to do the like, the next Night they took Counſel, about twenty of them, and agreed to aſſault the Town.</p>
               <p>This their Enterpriſe, when they declared to the Standard-Bearer of <hi>Titus,</hi> he and many other of the <hi>Romans</hi> went with them. They all ſcaling together, and clambering up the Breaches, got up upon the Wall, ſounding a Trumpet, and gave a great Shout. The <hi>Iews</hi> being at their reſt, as men oppreſs'd with Hunger and Wearineſs, and hearing this Allarum and Huzzah of the <hi>Romans,</hi> were wonderfully amazed, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the matter was, or how they ſhould defend themſelves. <hi>Titus</hi> alſo heard the Shout, and when he had enquired the matter, he choſe out certain valiant men, and drew towards the Breaches with them. In the mean ſeaſon, the day was broken, and the <hi>Jews</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from their Sleep, eſpied <hi>Titus</hi> upon the Walls, and marvelled thereat greatly. The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore gathering towards <hi>Titus,</hi> came very thick upon the Town, ſome by the Breaches of the Wall, and other ſome through the Vault, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont now and then to make Irruptions, and to recover
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46445:97"/>themſelves within the Town again. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Array againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the very Entry of the Temple; upon whom the <hi>Romans</hi> ran with their drawn Swords, for they had no other Armour, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> neither, being haſtily taken at ſuch a ſudden. The Battle waxed very hard, and wonderful vehement on both Parties; the like was never ſeen in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for every Man clave hard to his next Fellow, and no Man could flee on any ſide: wherefore the Battel wax'd ſtrong, with Clamours and Shouts on both Parties, now the joyful Shout of the Vanquiſhers, now the wailing on the other ſide: the <hi>Romans</hi> encourage their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and the <hi>Jews</hi> exhorting one another to dye manfully for the Glory of the Lord and his Temple, as neceſſity conſtrained them, and ſo doing that, thought they ſhould be counted for Sacrifices and Offerings: Which earneſtneſs on both ſides filled the Court of the Lord with Blood, that it ſtood like unto a Pool or Pond. And the Fight continued from the Morning till that time four days, but the <hi>Jews</hi> at length prevailing, <hi>Titus</hi> took with him <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Prince of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and went into the Houſe of the Sanctuary, and repreſented by him, to <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and the reſt of the Seditious; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this oppoſition of theirs, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to eſcape his Fury in caſe they provoked it by any further Reſiſtance, with all other ſpecious Reaſons for the bringing them to a Compliance, if they had not been obſtinately bent upon their own Ruine; but their wilfull Stubbornneſs made them refuſe all his gracious Offers. Whereupon, <hi>Titus</hi> departed out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again, and pitched his Tents without the City, in the ſame place where he encamped at firſt; for he was afraid both for himſelf and his Army, leſt they ſhould be circumvented and cloſed in, and ſlain cruelly in ſo great a City as that was.</p>
               <p>Certain of the Prieſts of that time and of the Nobles of the Town, with other godly men, did wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves, and come forth to <hi>Titus,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46445:98"/>themſelves to his Mercy, and were received of him peaceably with great Honour; whom <hi>Titus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be conducted into the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> to ſuſtain and ſuccour them, and to ſee that no <hi>Roman</hi> or other ſhould do them harm, or annoy them by any manner of means. Many other alſo of the <hi>Jews</hi> covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go forth of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but they were diſappointed by the Seditions, that they could not do as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Which <hi>Titus</hi> hearing of, he went again to the place where he was before, and the People ſeeing him, expreſſed a deſire to ſubmit themſelves to his mercy, which the Seditious taking notice of, they run upon them with their drawn Swords to kill them, who calling out for help to the <hi>Romans,</hi> theſe laſt made ſpeed to free them out of the hands of the Seditious; ſo roſe there a Fray in the midſt of the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Iews;</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> fled into the place called <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> which was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all, and the <hi>Iews</hi> followed after, and ſlew them even there. Whereupon <hi>Titus</hi> repreſented unto them their abominations in ſo polluting the Temple, and would have perſwaded them to have accepted of Peace and Repoſe. But ſeeing the Seditious obſtinate, and not giving any regard to his words, he choſe out of the <hi>Romans</hi> thirty thouſand valiant ſighting men, and gave them command to take and poſſeſs the entry of the Temple. Whereupon theſe <hi>Romans</hi> thought to have ſet upon the <hi>Iews</hi> when they were aſleep, but the <hi>Iews</hi> having intelligence of the matter, kept diligent watch, and withſtood the <hi>Romans</hi> all the night. But the <hi>Romans</hi> were not haſty to fight in the dark, leſt it might turn to their own harm. As ſoon therefore as it was day the <hi>Iews</hi> divided themſelves, and beſtowed their Companies at the Gates of the entrance, and ſought like men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Generals beſet the Temple round about, that not one of the <hi>Iews</hi> might eſcape out, and ſo Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel increaſed between them for the ſpace of ſeven days;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46445:98"/>ſometimes the <hi>Romans</hi> getting the upper hand of the <hi>Iews,</hi> driving them from the entrance: ſometimes the <hi>Iews</hi> incouraging themſelves, made the <hi>Romans</hi> retire, and purſued them to the Walls of <hi>Antochia;</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fought they theſe ſeven days.</p>
               <p>The Famin in the mean ſeaſon grew more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, ſo that no more Food was left. For the <hi>Iews</hi> now began to iſſue out, and to ſteal Horſes, Aſſes, and other Beaſts, whatſoever they could catch, even out of the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, that they might dreſs them ſome meat, and ſuſtain their lives, but the <hi>Romans</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, prevented that Relief. Nevertheleſs the principal Youths of the <hi>Jews</hi> made a ſally out, and drove in a great many Cattel of the <hi>Romans,</hi> fighting ſo deſperately for their Suſtenance, that all the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> could not hinder them, but returned with great prey and ſhouts to the Temple. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Romans</hi> took a young Boy of the <hi>Jews</hi> Priſoner, which with his Brother, who was of the party, had eſcaped to the Town, was of a vile Perſonage, evil-favoured, and of a low ſtature; perceiving he came forth again, and challenged any man of the <hi>Romans</hi> to fight him, ſaying, he was only one of the meaneſt and out-caſts of the <hi>Jews;</hi> though the <hi>Romans</hi> deſpiſed him, yet they durſt not fight with him, for that they conſidered they ſhould get no honour though they ſhould kill him, and yet they ran a hazard of being killed themſelves. But at length, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the inſulting Language of the <hi>Jew,</hi> one <hi>Pornus,</hi> one of the moſt valiant Souldiers of the <hi>Romans,</hi> came no ſooner to the <hi>Jew</hi> than that he was by him killed ſtreightway, to the ſhame and reproach of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeeing the Walls of the Temple, and three Walls that compaſſed the Town to be razed and pulled down, they conſulted what was beſt to be done. There was a great houſe joyned upon the ſide of the Temple that King <hi>Solomon</hi> had builded, of a great height, whoſe Walls alſo the Kings of the ſecond Temple had raiſed on high, and decked it with Timber of Firr and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:46445:99"/>Cedar Trees; the <hi>Jews</hi> went and anointed every where the Cedar Timber of the houſe with Brimſtone abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: ſo when the <hi>Romans</hi> came to aſſault the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple again, the <hi>Jews</hi> retired into that Palace, and went out another way. But the <hi>Romans</hi> not dreaming of this Stratagem, ſome climbed up to the Battlements of the houſe, others ſet up Ladders to ſcale it, and with ſhouts thought that the Palace was now taken, and that the <hi>Jews</hi> had no place left to flee unto for refuge. Thus when the Palace was full of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a certain <hi>Jew,</hi> a young man, vowing himſelf deſperately to die, went and ſhut up the Palace, and ſet fire on the Gates anointed before with Brimſtone and Pitch, and ſtraightway, the ſide Wall of the Houſe, and the whole building began to be on a light fire, and of the <hi>Romans</hi> moſt were burnt, ſome killed themſelves, and the reſt we killed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as they would have made their eſcapes.</p>
               <p>There was a great <hi>Roman</hi> Commander in this fire, whoſe name was <hi>Artorius,</hi> who looking forth from the top of the houſe, ſaw one of his dear Friends called <hi>Lucius</hi> ſtanding by <hi>Titus,</hi> to whom <hi>Artorius</hi> called, ſaying, My dear friend <hi>Lucius,</hi> get on thy Armour and come hither, that I may leap down upon thee, and thou may receive me. If I die, I make thee my Heir, if thou die, thy Children ſhall inherit my Goods. Wherefore <hi>Lucius</hi> ran and held up his lap open at the houſe ſide, and <hi>Artorius</hi> leapt down and light upon him with ſuch weight, that they both died therewith. <hi>Titus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Covenant they made before their death, to be written on a Sword with blood, and their Friendſhip to be noted in the Chronicles of the Romans, that it might be an example to all men to learn true Friendſhip by.</p>
               <p>There was a certain rich Woman in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of a Noble Houſe alſo, whoſe name was <hi>Miriam:</hi> Her dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> but when ſhe perceived the Wars to grow more and more in the time of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:46445:99"/>ſhe came up with her Neighbours to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> bringing with her not only her Man-ſervants, and Women-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and all her Family, but alſo her Goods and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which were very great.</p>
               <p>When the hunger was grievous at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the Seditious went from Houſe to Houſe to ſeek meat; they came alſo to this Womans Houſe, and took away from her by force all that ever ſhe had, and left her nothing remaining. By this means ſhe was oppreſt with very great hunger, ſo that ſhe wiſhed her ſelf out of the world, but her time was not yet come to dye: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhe might ſlack her hunger, and ſuſtain her ſelf, ſhe began to ſcrape in the Chaff and duſt, for Beaſts dung, but could find none. She had one Son; and when ſhe ſaw the Famine was greater and greater upon her, ſhe laid aſide all Womanhood and mercy, and took upon her an horrible Cruelty; for when ſhe heard her Boy weep, and ask for meat, which ſhe had not to give him, ſhe ſaid unto him, what ſhall I do, my Son? for the wrath of God hath environed the whole City, in every corner thereof the Famine reigneth, without the City the ſword killeth up all; within we ſtand in fear of the Seditious, our enemies prevail without, in the Town are fires, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ruines of Houſes, Famines, Peſtilence, ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying, ſo that I cannot feed thee, my Son. Now therefore, my Son, if I ſhould dye for hunger, to whom ſhould I leave thee being yet a Child? I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped once, that when thou ſhouldeſt come to mans eſtate, thou ſhouldeſt have ſuſtained my age with meat, drink, and cloth, and after, when I ſhould dye, to bury me honourably, like as I was minded to bury thee, if thou ſhouldeſt have dyed before me. But now, my ſon, thou art as good as dead already, for I have no meat to bring thee up withall, becauſe of this great Famine, and Cruelty of the Enemies both within and without: If thou ſhouldeſt dye now among others, thou ſhouldeſt have no good nor honourable Tomb, as I would wiſh thee; wherefore I have thought good to chuſe thee a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:46445:100"/>Sepulchre, even my own body, leſt thou ſhouldſt dye, and Dogs eat thee in the Streets; I will therefore be thy Grave, and thou ſhalt be my food: and for that, if thou hadſt lived and grown to mans eſtate, thou oughteſt by right to have nouriſhed me, and fed me with thy fleſh, and with it ſuſtain my age; before that Famine devour thee, and thy Body be conſumed, render unto thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which ſhe gave unto thee, for thou comeſt of her, and thou ſhalt return into her. For I will bring thee unto the ſelf ſame ſhop, in the which the breath of life was breathed into thy Noſtrils, foraſmuch as thou art my well-beloved Son, whom I have loved always with all my ſtrength: Be therefore meat for thy mother, and ignominy and reproach to the Seditious, that by violence have taken away our food. Wherefore, my Son, hear my voice; and ſuſtain my Soul and my Life, and go to the end that is determined for thee by my hands, thy lot be in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and Paradice. Be thou meat for me, and rebuke and ſhame for the Seditious, that they may be compelled to ſay, <hi>Lo, a Woman hath killed her Son, and eaten him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when ſhe had thus ſpoken to her Son, ſhe took the Child, and turning her face away leſt ſhe ſhould ſee him dye, ſhe killed him with a Sword, and after cut his Body into certain pieces, whereof ſome ſhe roaſted, ſome ſhe ſod, and when ſhe had eaten of them, ſhe laid up the reſt to keep.</p>
               <p>The ſavour of the Fleſh roaſted, when it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Streets to the People, they ſaid one to another: See, here is the ſmell of roaſt-meat. Which thing came to the knowledge of the Seditious at length, who went into the Houſe of the Woman, and ſpake roughly unto her, why ſhould'ſt thou have meat to live with, and we dye of hunger? The Woman made them anſwer, and ſaid unto them, Be not diſpleaſed, I beſeech you, with your Hand-maid for this, for you ſhall ſee I have reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved part for you: ſit ye down therefore, and I will bring it to you, that ye may taſte thereof, for it is very
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46445:100"/>good meat. And by and by ſhe covered the Table, and ſet before them part of the Child's Fleſh, ſaying, Eat, I pray you, here is a Childs hand, ſee, here is his Foot, and other parts; and never report it was another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Child, but my one only Son that ye knew with me? him I bare, and have alſo eaten part, part have I kept for you. When ſhe had ſpoken, ſhe burſt out and wept, ſaying, Oh, my Son, my Son, how ſweet waſt thou to me whilſt thou yet lived, and now at thy death alſo thou art ſweeter to me than Hony! for thou haſt not only fed me in this moſt grievous Famine, but haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me againſt the wrath of the Seditious, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were incenſed towards me, when the ſmell of the meat brought them into my houſe, now therefore are they become my friends, for they ſit at my Table, and I have made them a Feaſt with my Fleſh.</p>
               <p>After, ſhe turned to the Seditious, and bade them eat, and ſatisfie themſelves: for why (ſaith ſhe) ſhould you abhor my meat which I have ſet before you? I have ſatisfied my ſelf therewith, why therefore do not you eat of the fleſh of my Son? taſte and ſee how ſweet my Sons Fleſh is, I dare ſay, you will ſay, it is good meat, what needeth pitty? ought ye to be more moved therewith than a Woman, than a Mother? if you will in no wiſe eat of the Sacrifice of my Son, when as I have eaten thereof my ſelf, ſhall not this be a ſhame for you that I ſhould have a better heart and a greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than you? behold, I have prepared a fair Table for you, moſt valiant men, why eat you not? is it not good fare that I have dreſt for you? and it is your will that I ſhould make you this Feaſt; it had been my part rather to have been moved with pity of my Son, than you, and how chances it therefore, that you are more merciful than I? did you not ſpoil my houſe, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46445:101"/>I did this deed; the <hi>Jews</hi> hearing of this matter, were wonderfuly ſmitten in ſadneſs; yea, even the Governours of the Seditious began to ſtoop when they heard of this, ſo that they all in a manner deſired death, they were ſo amazed at this horrible Act. Many therefore of the common people ſtole out in the night forth of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with all their ſubſtance to the <hi>Romans</hi> Camp, and ſhewed <hi>Titus</hi> of this, who wept thereat, and was ſorry for the matter exceedingly.</p>
               <p>After which, <hi>Titus</hi> commanded to bring an Iron Ram, and to bend it againſt the new Wall which the Seditious had raiſed, that they might batter it down; but many of the Nobles among the Seditious came forth unto <hi>Titus</hi> and made Peace with him, whom he placed among his chief men.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Romans ſet on fire one of the Gates of the Temple, that was ſhut, whoſe door was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Silver, and while the Timber of it burnt, the Silver melted and ran upon the ground: ſo when the Gate was open, the way appeared which leadeth to the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Titus</hi> ſaw it, he honoured it with great Reverence, and forbade his people that none ſhould come nigh it. Wherefore he commanded a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to be publiſhed throughout all his Camp to this Tenour, <hi>whoſoever cometh near the Sanctuary, ſhall ſuffer death for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He appointed alſo a ſtrong band of men to keep the Temple, that it might not be prophaned and unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by any of his: but his Princes and Captains an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, unleſs this houſe be ſet on fire thou ſhalt never ſubdue this People, in regard that to preſerve it they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:46445:101"/>
               <p>The Seditious Jews that remained in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſeeing the Romans depart from the Temple, and leaving Guards behind, they came upon them with their Swords drawn, and ſlew every ſoul of them: which <hi>Titus</hi> hearing, he brought his whole Army thither againſt the Seditious, and killed many of them, the reſt fled by Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day the Romans ſet fire on the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> laying wood to the doors that were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Gold, and then firing it; ſo after the Gold waxed hot, and the Timber burnt, the <hi>Sanctum Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> was open, that men might ſee it in the ninth day of the 5th Month: the Romans thereupon ruſhing into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> gave a great ſhout while it burnt, which when <hi>Titus</hi> heard, he haſted to quench the fire, and ſave the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> but he could not do it, becauſe it was ſet on fire in ſo many places: Thereupon <hi>Titus</hi> cried unto them, that they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, but they would not hear him: for as a vehement flood of waters breaketh thorough all things and drives them before; with ſuch a furious violence the Gentiles ruſhed upon the Lord's Temple, the fire flaming every where out of meaſure.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Titus</hi> ſaw he could not reſtrain them from the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> with Words, he drew out his Sword, blaming the Captains of his own People, and others that were not <hi>Romans</hi> he killed; and he cried out ſo long and ſo loud upon them that he was grown hoarſe.</p>
               <p>The Prieſts that were within the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> withſtood the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtoutly, till they were no longer able to lift up their hands; wherefore, when they ſaw there was no other ſafeguard left, they leap'd into the Fire, and divers other <hi>Jews</hi> with them, and ſo burn'd all together, ſaying, <hi>What, ſhould we live any longer now there is no Temple?</hi> Yet <hi>Titus</hi> ceaſed not to ſtrike the People, and chaſe them from the Temple; and being grown ſo weak that all his Strength failed him, he fell
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46445:102"/>upon the ground, and forbore crying to them any more.</p>
               <p>After that the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> was burn'd, <hi>Titus</hi> aroſe, and entring thereinto, he ſaw the Glory and Magnificence thereof, and believed it was the Houſe of the Lord; for as yet the Fire had not conſumed all.</p>
               <p>The Seditious that yet remained at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> to be burn'd, they ſet the reſt of the Temple on Fire themſelves, with all the Houſes that were filled with Treaſure, and all ſorts of precious Jewels; and where they knew there remained yet ſome Victuals, they ſet it alſo on fire, leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould receive benefit thereby.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Romans</hi> quenched the Fire, and ſet up their Idols and Images in the Temple, offering burn'd Offerings unto them, and blaſpheming, mocking, and railing at the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Laws in the preſence of their Idols. About that time aroſe one who prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied a Lye unto the Seditious that remained yet in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> exhorting them to play the Men, and oppoſe their Enemies; for now, ſaid he, ſhall the Temple be built by it ſelf, without humane Hands, that God may declare his Power unto the <hi>Romans,</hi> who now glory in themſelves to have overcome the <hi>Jews:</hi> therefore, if you fight ſtoutly this day, the Temple ſhall erect it ſelf. Hereupon the Seditious ſet furiouſly upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſlew many of them, which made the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had favoured them formerly, to kill them like Sheep.</p>
               <p>The whole <hi>Roman</hi> Army being now come into the Temple, and the <hi>Jews</hi> fled to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> ſet up their Idols in the Lords Temple, and railed at the <hi>Iews.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Seditious continued in their Pride and Obſtinacy; but a certain Man, of Royal Blood, whoſe Name was <hi>Serack,</hi> accompanied with all his Brethren and Sons that were there with him of the King's Blood, came down from Mount <hi>Sion</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:46445:102"/>who received them honourably, and gently ordered them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and <hi>Schimeon</hi> underſtood that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack</hi> and the reſt were gone, and had yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Titus,</hi> they went and ſet fire upon all that was in the Kings Palace, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have no Commodity thereby.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to the Temple, where they found certain Commanders and Captains whom <hi>Titus</hi> had put in Authority about the Temple, whom they either killed or uſed after ſuch a deſpightful Manner, that <hi>Titus</hi> commanded all the <hi>Iews</hi> ſhould be ſlain that ſhould be found in the Streets of the City. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jehochanan</hi> and <hi>Schimeon</hi> fled, and hid themſelves in certain Caves; moſt of the reſt ſubmitted themſelves to <hi>Titus,</hi> and were gently received. Then <hi>Titus</hi> went up to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> took it, and razed the Walls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Three days after, <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> ſore vexed with Hunger, left his place where he lurked, and came to <hi>Titus,</hi> fell down before him, and kiſſed his Feet, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Save me, O Lord, King. <hi>Titus</hi> commanded him to be fettered with iron Chains; and when he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to be carried about the Camp ſo bound, and to be mocked of all men for the ſpace of ſeven days, he commanded to hang him, and ſo got he a juſt reward for his cruelty.</p>
               <p>Afterward came <hi>Schimeon</hi> forth of his Den being driven to it by Famine. He had put on Kingly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; but being brought before <hi>Titus,</hi> who commanded him to be faſt bound, and to be led about the whole Hoſt, that he might be derided and mocked: afterward he was put to a ſore death; firſt his head was ſtricken off, then he was cut in pieces and caſt unto the Dogs; ſo he died an abominable death, being puniſhed for his Iniquity.</p>
               <p>The number of the <hi>Jews</hi> as well Citizens as others, that came unto the Feaſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that were ſlain partly by the <hi>Romans,</hi> partly by the Seditious, during
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46445:103"/>the whole time of theſe Wars, was known to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred thouſand, beſides them whoſe number was not known; only they were counted which were ſlain and burled. Beſides them, they alſo are not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that after the death of <hi>Jehochanan,</hi> died with <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer</hi> the Son of <hi>Anani</hi> the Prieſt: they that were led Priſoners by <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſixteen thouſand men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleazer</hi> having made his eſcape from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> got into <hi>Mezirah,</hi> a fortified place, whither many <hi>Jews</hi> flocking to him, he defended it for ſome time againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> But the Walls being battered down, and finding it impoſſible to make any longer reſiſtance, they all, upon <hi>Eleazer</hi>'s remonſtrances, reſolved rather to die than live. Whereupon, the day before they expected the <hi>Romans</hi> would enter the Town, <hi>Eleazer</hi>'s compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons killed their Wives and Children, and caſt their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into Ciſterns and Wells that were in <hi>Mezirah,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and ſtopping them with earth. Afterward iſſued <hi>Eleazer</hi> the Prieſt out of the Town with all his men, and forced a Battel upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whom the <hi>Jews</hi> killed a great number, and fought ſo long, till they all died manfully for the Lord God.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Titus</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he reigned two years after the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then died. He was a very eloquent man, expert in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, and he writ divers Books in both Tongues. He loved moſt intirely Juſtice and Equity; for he waſted the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt his will, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereunto, yea, all the miſchief that came upon it, happened thorough the malice and naughtineſs of the Seditious, as was before mentioned.</p>

But when he heard his Captains and chief Officers murmured at it, he appointed them all to meet him in his great Hall, and commanded <hi>Irene</hi> to dreſs and adorn her ſelf in all her Jewels, and moſt gorgeous Apparel (not acquainting her in the leaſt with any part of his Deſign) taking her by the hand, he led this miracle of Beauty in the midſt of the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s, who, dazled with the Brightneſs of this Illuſtrious Lady, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their Errour, profeſſing that their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had juſt cauſe to paſs his time in ſolacing himſelf with ſo peerleſs a Paragon: but he on a ſudden twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his left hand in the ſoft curles of her hair, and with the other drawing out his crooked Semiter, at one blow ſtruck off her Head from her Shoulders; and ſo at once made an end of his Love and her Life, leaving all the Aſſiſtants in a fearful amaze, and horrour of an act of that cruelty.</p>

The names of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus inhumanely dealt with, were Captain <hi>Towerſon, Thompſon, Beaumont, Collins, Colſon, Wibber, Rampſey, Johnſon, Ford,</hi> and <hi>Brown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="135">CXXXV. In the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, (upon the alteration of Religion) there was an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and divers other Countreys, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many were taken, and executed by Marſhal Law; the chief Leaders were ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and there exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. The Sedition being thus ſuppreſs'd, it is memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable what cruel Sport Sir <hi>William Kingston</hi> made by vertue of his Office (which was Provoſt Marſhal) upon Men in Miſery. One <hi>Boyer,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Bodmin</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> had been amongſt the Rebels, not willingly, but enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; to him the Provoſt ſent word that he would come and dine with him; for whom the Mayor made great Proviſion. A little before Dinner, the Provoſt took the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46445:104"/>Mayor aſide, and whiſper'd him in the ear, That an Execution muſt be that day done in the Town, and therefore required that a pair of Gallows ſhould be ſet up againſt Dinner ſhould be done. The Mayor failed not of his Charge: preſently after Dinner, the Provoſt taking the Mayor by the hand, entreated him to lead him to the place where the Gallows was; which when he beheld, he asked if he thought them to be ſtrong enough? Yes, ſaid the Mayor, doubtleſs they are. Well then, ſaid the Provoſt, get you up ſpeedily, for they are provided for you. I hope, anſwered the Mayor, you mean not as you ſpeak? In faith, ſaid the Provoſt, there is no Remedy, for you have been a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Rebel; and ſo without reſpite or defence he was hang'd to death. Near the ſame place dwelt a Miller, who had been a buſie Actor in that Rebellion; who fearing the approach of the Marſhal, told a ſturdy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, his Servant, that he had occaſion to go from home, and therefore bad him, that if any came to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Miller, he ſhould not ſpeak of him, but ſay that he was the Miller, and had been ſo for three Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So the Provoſt came and called for the Miller, when out comes the Servant, and ſaith, He was the man. The Provoſt demanded how long he had kept the Mill? Theſe three Years, anſwered the Servant. Then the Provoſt commanded his men to lay hold on him, and hang him on the next Tree: at this the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cried out, that he was not the Miller, but the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's Man. Nay Sir, ſaid the Provoſt, I will take you at your Word. If thou be'eſt the Miller, thou art a buſie Knave; if thou art not, thou art a falſe lying Knave: and howſoever, thou canſt never do thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter better Service than to hang for him; and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more ado he was diſpatched.</p>
               <p n="136">CXXXVI. King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was a great Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. On a time, a <hi>Jew</hi> refuſing to lend this King ſo much Money as he required, the King cauſed every day one of his greateſt Teeth to be pulled out, by the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46445:105"/>ſpace of ſeven days, and then the poor <hi>Jew</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give the King ten thouſand Marks of Silver that the one Tooth which he had left might not be pulled out.</p>
               <p n="137">CXXXVII. To which, I will add an Inſtance or two of cruel Maſſacres. In the Year 1506. in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> upon the tenth day of <hi>April,</hi> many of the City went to the Church of St. <hi>Dominick</hi>'s to hear Maſs. On the leſt ſide of this Church there is a Chappel, much reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by thoſe of the Country, and called <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chappel. Upon the Altar there ſtands a Crucifix, the Wound of whoſe ſide is covered over with a piece of glaſs. Some of thoſe that came thither to do their Devotions caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Eyes upon this Hole, it ſeemed to them, that a certain kind of gilmmering light came forth of it; then happy he that could firſt cry a Miracle; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſaid, That God ſhewed the Teſtimonies of his Preſence. A <hi>Jew</hi> that was but lately become a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> there, denied that it was any Miracle; ſaying, It was not likely that out of a dry piece of Wood there ſhould come ſuch a Light. Now albeit many of the Standers by doubted of the Miracle, yet hearing a <hi>Jew</hi> deny it, they began to murmur, calling him wicked Apoſtate, a deteſtable Enemy to Jeſus Chriſt; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ſufficiently reviled him with Words, all the Multitude, foaming with Anger, fall upon him, pluck off the Hair of his Head and Beard, tread upon him, trail him into the Church-yard, beat him to Death, and kindling a great Fire, caſt the dead Body into it. All the reſidue of the People ran to this muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Company: there a certain Fryar made a Sermon, wherein he eagerly egged on his Auditors to revenge the injury our Lord had received. The People, mad enough of themſelves, were clean caſt off of the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by this Exhortation. Beſides this, two other Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars took and held up a Croſs as high as they could, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, Revenge, Revenge, Hereſie, Hereſie, down with wicked Hereſie, and deſtroy the wicked Nation.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46445:105"/>Then, like hungry Dogs, they fall upon the miſerable <hi>Jews,</hi> cut the Throats of a great number, and drag them half dead to the Fires, many of which they made for the purpoſe. They regarded not Age or Sex, but murdered Men, Women, and Children; they brake open Doors, ruſh into Rooms, daſh out Childrens Brains againſt the Walls; they went inſolently into Churches, to pluck out thence little Children, old Men, and young Maids, that had taken hold of the Altars, the Croſſes, and Images of Saints, crying, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericordia,</hi> Mercy; there they either ſo murdered them preſently, or threw them out alive into the Fire. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that carried the port and ſhew of <hi>Jews</hi> found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in great danger, and ſome were killed, and others wounded, before they could make proof that they had no Relation to them. Some that bare a Grudge to others, as they met them did but cry <hi>Jews,</hi> and they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently beaten down, without having any liberty or lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to anſwer for themſelves. The Magiſtrates were not ſo hardy as to oppoſe themſelves againſt the fury of the People; ſo that in three days the Cut-throats killed above two thouſand <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Perſons. The King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the News of this horrible hurley-burley, was extreamly wrath, and ſuddenly diſpatched away <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Almida</hi> and <hi>Jaques Lopez,</hi> with full power to puniſh ſo great Offences, who cauſed a great number of the Seditious to be executed. The Fryars that had lift up the Croſs, and animated the People to Murder, were degraded, and afterwards hanged and burn'd. The Magiſtrates that had been ſlack to repreſs this Riot, were ſome put out of Office, and others fined. The City was alſo disfranchiſed of many Priviledges and Honours.</p>
               <p n="138">CXXXVIII. In the Year 1572. was the bloody <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian</hi> Matins, wherein was ſpilt ſo much Chriſtian Blood, that it flowed through the Streets like Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, in great abundance: and this Butchery of Men, Women, and Children, continued ſo long, that the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46445:106"/>principal Rivers of the Kingdom were ſeen covered with murdered Bodies? and their ſtreams ſo dried and ſtain'd with humane Blood; that they who dwelt far from the place where this Barbarons Act was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, abhorred the Waters of thoſe Rivers; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to uſe either it, or to eat of the Fiſh taken therein for a long time after. This tragedy was thus cunningly plotted. A Peace was made with the Proteſtants, for aſſurance whereof a Marriage was ſolemnized between <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Navarr,</hi> chief of the Proteſtant party, and <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> the King's Siſter. At this wedding there aſſembled the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Admiral <hi>Coligne,</hi> and divers others of chief note; but there was not ſo much Wine drank as Blood ſhed at it. At midnight the Watch-bell rung, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> are taken Priſoners, the Admiral murdered in his Bed, and thirty thouſand at the leaſt of the moſt potent men of the Religion ſent by the way of the red Sea, to find the neareſt paſſage to the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="139">CXXXIX. In the year 1311. and in the time of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, all the order of the Knights Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers being condemned at the Council of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and adjudged to die; <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, King of <hi>France,</hi> ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Pope, and out of a covetuous deſire of ſtore of Confiſcations, gave way for men to charge them with Crimes; and ſo theſe innocents were put to death. The great maſter of the order, together with two other of the principal Perſons, one whereof was Brother to the Dolphin of <hi>Viennais,</hi> were publickly burnt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="140">CXL. The Maſſacre of <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randol</hi> and <hi>Chabriers,</hi> happened in the year 1544. the inſtrument of it being <hi>Minier</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Aix;</hi> for having condemned this poor People of Hereſy, he muſtered up a ſmall Army, and ſet fire on the Villages: they of <hi>Merandol</hi> ſeeing the flame, with their Wives and Children flew into the Woods, but were there butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered or ſent to the Galleys. One Boy they took,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46445:106"/>placed him againſt a Tree, and ſhot him to death with Calivers. Twenty five which had hid themſelves in a Cave, were in part ſtifled, in part burnt. In <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briers</hi> they ſo inhumanely dealt with the young Wives and Maids, that moſt of them died immediately after; the men and Women were put to the Sword, the Children were re-baptized; eight hundred men were murdered in a Cave, and forty men put together in an old Barn and burnt: yea, ſuch was the cruelty of theſe Souldiers to theſe poor Women, that when ſome of them had clambered to the top of the Barn, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leap down, the Souldiers beat them back again with their Pikes.</p>
               <p n="141">CXLI. King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and half Brother of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, injoyed the Crown unquietly which he got unjuſtly. Oppreſſed and broken by the <hi>Danes,</hi> he was fain to buy his peace of them, of the yearly Tribute of ten thouſand pounds; inhaunced to forty thouſand pounds within a ſhort time after. Which Monies were raiſed upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by the name of <hi>Danegelt.</hi> Weary of this Exaction, he plotted warily with his Subjects to kill all the <hi>Danes</hi> as they ſlept in their Beds, which accordingly was put in execution on St. <hi>Brices</hi> night, <hi>November</hi> 13. <hi>Anno</hi> 1012.</p>
               <p n="142">CXLII. But to divert the reader, after ſo ſad an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment as is this mournful ſubject, it will not be improper to give him a proſpect of the divers Cuſtoms of ſeveral Nations in the Univerſe. The Cuſtom of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> is, not to puniſh any Subject with death though he is condemned; but one of the Lictors is ſent to the Malefactor with the ſign of Death carried before him: which received, the Criminal goes home and puts himſelf to death. To change death into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is held unlawful; and it is ſaid, that when one had received the ſign of death, and had intentions to fly out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> his Mother being apprehenſive of it, faſtened her Girdle about his Neek, and he not offering
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46445:107"/>to reſiſt her with his hands, leſt he ſhould thereby faſten a reproach upon his Family, was ſtrangled by her.</p>
               <p n="143">CXLIII. In the greater <hi>India,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Var</hi> (in which St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is ſaid to be ſlain and buried) he amongſt them who is to undergo a Capital Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, begs of the King that he may rather dye in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſome God, than an inglorious death by the hands of the Hang-man. If the King in mercy grant him it, by his Kindred, with great Joy, he is led through the City with mighty Pomp; he is placed in a Chair, with ſharp Knives all hung about his Neck. When he comes to the place of Execution, with a loud voice he affirms, he will dye in honour of this or that God: then taking one of the Knives, he wounds himſelf where he pleaſes, then a ſecond, then a third, till his ſtrength fail, and ſo he is honourably burn'd by his Friends.</p>
               <p n="144">CXLIV. The <hi>Spartans,</hi> when they brought home with them any Friends or Gueſts, ſhewing them the Doors, they uſed to ſay, <hi>Not a Word that is ſpoken paſſes out here. Plutarch</hi> alſo tells us, that by the Inſtitution of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> when they invited any to feaſt with them, he who was the elder ſtood at the door of the dining Room, and pointing to it, ſaid to all that entred, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſpoken paſſes theſe doors to be told abroad;</hi> expreſſing thereby, that all the Gueſts had a full free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty to ſpeak without any conſtraint upon them. The ſame <hi>Spartans,</hi> in thoſe Feaſts of theirs that are called <hi>Phiditiae,</hi> have their Prefects or Stewards, who bring in two or three of the <hi>Helotes</hi> (that is, their Slaves) drunk and intoxicate with Wine, and expoſe them publickly in that poſture to their Youth, that they may ſee what it is to be drunk, and that by their unſeemly and uncomely Behaviour they might be brought into a deteſtation of that Vice, and to a love of Temperance and Sobriety.</p>
               <p n="145">CXLV. The <hi>Aegpptians</hi> at their feaſts uſe to carry about the dryed Anatomy of a Man in a Coffin; not ſo
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46445:107"/>much in memory of <hi>Oſyris,</hi> ſlain by <hi>Trypho,</hi> and in a Cheſt caſt into the Sea, but that being inflamed with Wine, they might mutually exhort one another to the uſe and enjoyment of theſe preſent good things, becauſe e're long all of them would be as that Skeleton.</p>
               <p n="146">CXLVI. The <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> have ſtanding before the Gates of their City two Coffins; one wherein the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Free-men, the other wherein thoſe of Servants are carried in a Cart to Burial, which they do without weeping; their mourning is finiſhed upon the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day with a Feaſt among their Friends; there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a publick Poyſon kept in that City, which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to that Perſon who hath made it appear to the Magiſtrates, of ſix hundred (that is, their Senate) that he hath ſufficient Cauſes to deſire to die: alſo they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no Man to enter into the Town with any Weapon, but there is appointed at the Gate one to receive them at their Entrance, and to deliver them back at their Departure. Thus, as their Entertainments to others are humane, ſo to themſelves they are ſafe.</p>
               <p n="147">CXLVII. There is a memorable Cuſtom of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> That a freed man, convicted of Ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Patron, ſhall forfeit the Priviledge of his Freedom: as who ſhould ſay, We refuſe to have thee a Citizen who art ſo baſe a valuer of ſo great a gift; nor can we ever be brought to believe that he can be advantagious to the City whom we perceive to be villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous at home: go thy way then, and be ſtill a Servant, ſeeing thou knoweſt not how to eſteem of thy Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p n="148">CXLVIII. The <hi>Romans,</hi> when they went into the Country, or travelled ſar, at their Return uſed to ſend a Meſſenger before them to their Wives, to let them know, that they are at hand; and upon this reaſon they did it, becauſe Women, in abſence of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, are ſuppoſed to be detained with many Cares and much Employment, poſſibly they have Brawls and Diſcontents in the Family; that therefore all theſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46445:108"/>might be laid aſide, and that they might have time to receive their Husbands in Peace, and with Chearfulneſs, they ſend before them the News of their Arrival.</p>
               <p n="149">CXLIX. It was a Cuſtom in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that upon a certain ſtated and appointed day, ſome particular Perſons were carried about in a Chariot, to whom it was given in charge, that they ſhould paſs throughout the whole City, and making a ſtand at whoſe door they pleaſed, they ſhould there ſing aloud the faults that the perſons in that houſe were guilty of: they might not cauſeleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach any, but publiſh the very Truth: to which purpoſe they were ſtudiouſly before hand to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the manner of the life of each Citizen. The end of this Cuſtom was, that Men might be moved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by the conſideration of that Shame which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly provided for a diſhoneſt Life.</p>
               <p n="150">CL. The black People or <hi>Caffares</hi> in the Land of <hi>Moſambique,</hi> have a Cuſtom among them, That when they go to War againſt their Enemies, he that taketh or killeth moſt men is accounted the beſt and braveſt Man, and moſt reſpected. As a Proof of his Gallantry to his King, of as many as he hath ſlain or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners he cuts off the Privy Members, dries them well, becauſe they ſhould not rot: with theſe thus dried, he comes before his King with great Reverence, in the preſence of the principal Men of the Village; where taking theſe Members one by one into his Mouth, he ſpits them on the ground at the King's feet, which the King with great Thanks accepteth; and the more to reward and recompence their Valour, he cauſeth them all to be taken up, and given him again for a ſign and token of Honour. Whereby, from that time forwards, they are accounted as Knights; and they take all thoſe Members wherewith the King hath thus honoured them, and tye them all upon a ſtring like a Bracelet or Chain: and when they marry, and go to any Wedding or Feaſts, the Bride or Wife of ſuch Knights do wear the foreſaid Chain about their Necks, which amongſt them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46445:108"/>is as great an honour as it is with us to wear the golden Fleece or the Garter in <hi>England;</hi> and the Brides of ſuch Knights are therewith as proud as if they were the mightieſt Queens in all the World.</p>
               <p n="151">CLI. The manner of making War amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the recovery of ſuch things as were injuriouſly detained, was this. They ſent forth <hi>Feciales,</hi> or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, whom they alſo called Orators, crowned with <hi>Vervain,</hi> that they might make the Gods Witneſſes, who are the Revengers of broken Leagues. He that was crowned with <hi>Vervain</hi> carried a Turf with graſs upon it out of the Tower; and the Ambaſſador, when he came to their Borders who were the Offerers of the Injury, covering his Face with a woollen Veil; Hear, O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſaith he, hear the Borders (and then naming the People whoſe Borders they were) hear ye that which is right: I am the publick Meſſenger of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> and juſtly and piouſly come as their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador. Then he ſpeaks all their Demands, and calls <hi>Iupiter</hi> to witneſs. If I unjuſtly or impiouſly demand thoſe men or thoſe things to be yielded back to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> do thou then never ſuffer me to return in ſafety to my own Country. This he doth when he is entred upon their Borders, when he meets any man, when he enters the Gates of the City, when he comes into the Market place: then if that which he demands is not reſtored, at the end of thirty three days, he thus declares War, who is the Father of the Fatherhood, the chief Herald, and who is crowned with <hi>Vervain.</hi> Hear <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Iuno Quirinus,</hi> celeſtial, terreſtrial, and infernal Gods, I call you to witneſs, that this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (and names it) is unjuſt and will not do right: but of theſe matters the elder of us will conſult in our own Country how to regain our Right. Then he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Rome,</hi> they enter upon the Debate: and if it is decreed as Right, then the Herald returns with a Spear in his hand pointed with Iron. Upon their Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (before three Children at leaſt) he pronounces
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46445:109"/>that ſuch a People have offered force to, and injured the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that War be made with them: for which cauſe I and the People of <hi>Rome</hi> declare and make War with ſuch a People; and when he hath ſaid this, he throws the Javelin or Spear upon their Borders.</p>
               <p n="152">CLII. The <hi>Jews</hi> before they entred Battel, by publick Edict commanded them to depart from the Army, who were newly married, and had not brought home their Wives; alſo all thoſe that had planted a Vineyard, and had not yet eaten of the Fruits of it: and thoſe who had begun to build a Houſe, and had not finiſhed it, together with theſe, all ſuch as were cowardly and fearful; leſt the deſires of thoſe things, which the one had begun, or the faint-heartedneſs of the other, ſhould occaſion them to fight feebly; and alſo by their fears poſſeſs the hearts of ſuch as were Bold and Valiant.</p>
               <p n="153">CLIII. It was a common uſe among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and divers other Nations, as well amongſt Princes as Private Perſons, that if there had happened any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of an extraordinary Character amongſt them, they uſed to ſend a publick Officer or private Meſſenger to let them know (whom they conceived they had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by) that they did ſolemnly renounce all friendſhip with them, and that they did forbid them their Houſe, and all expectations of any Rites of Hoſpitality. And they thought it unreaſonable to hear him by Word or deed, who had been their Friend, till they had ſent him this Declaration, that he might ſtand upon his Guard. Thus <hi>Badius</hi> the <hi>Campanian,</hi> betwixt both Armies, renounced friendſhip with <hi>Criſpinus</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> that ſo he might have the freedom to aſſault him as an Enemy: and thus dealt King <hi>Amaſis</hi> with <hi>Polycrates,</hi> not that he had diſſobliged him, but that he feared his misfortune.</p>
               <p n="154">CLIV. Amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they had this cuſtome, that when any one was accuſed in the Court for the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46445:109"/>breach of the Laws, though it did plainly appear that he was guilty, yet ſhould he not be immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but firſt there ſhould be an exact inquiry made into the whole courſe of his life, and a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould be taken, whether his evil and unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom actions, or his gallant and commendable ones were the moſt: and then if the number of his baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy doings were found to be the greateſt, he was condemned; if otherwiſe, he was abſolved. For they thought it was beyond human power perpetually to keep that which was right, and that they were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted good, not who never did amiſs, but who for the moſt part did that which was honeſt.</p>
               <p n="155">CLV. The cuſtom of eſtabliſhing a mutual and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Friendſhip betwixt two, and alſo of Princes when they entred into inviolable Leagues or Alliances, was this; they joyned their right Hands, and then both their Thumbs were hard bound about with a ſtring; as ſoon as the Blood came into the Extremities of them, they were lightly pricked that the Blood came, and then each licked ſome of the others Blood. The Friendſhip or League contracted by this ceremony was held moſt ſacred, as being ſigned with their own Blood. In this manner the Inhabitants of the Iſland <hi>Palmaria,</hi> the <hi>Scythians, Georgians,</hi> and divers other Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their Friendſhip, and as we read in <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> themſelves.</p>
               <p n="156">CLVI. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were wont, without much examination, to hang up ſuch as were ſuſpected of Theft, and upon the third day after, the matter was ſtrictly examined of the Judge, then if it was found that they had really committed the Theft, whereof they had been accuſed, they left them hanging upon the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but if they were judged to be innocent, they were taken thence, and buried, with a Preface of Honour at the Publick charge.</p>

                  <hi>George Caſtriot,</hi> alias <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince <hi>Hungary,</hi> and other it's bordering Countries, do now daily afford us matter of Diſcourſe. This <hi>George</hi> was deſcended of an ancient Family, which had long reigned in <hi>Epirus,</hi> or <hi>Asbania,</hi> a part of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> his Father ſurmounted his Predeceſſors in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Gravity, and Magnanimity, in corporal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comelineſs of Perſon: his Mother was <hi>Voiſava,</hi> Daughter of the King of the <hi>Tribullians,</hi> a Woman for Beauty, Wiſdom, and Excellency of Spirit, ſurpaſſing moſt of her Sex. God bleſſed theſe Perſons with nine Children, four Sons and five Daughters; whereof this <hi>George</hi> was the youngeſt, upon whoſe Arm, when he was born, appeared the form of a Sword, as naturally imprinted as if it had been engraven by the moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Artificer.</p>
               <p>Then it was the <hi>Turks</hi> extended their Conqueſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe: John Castriot,</hi> amongſt other Princes, was conſtrained to ſue for Peace; which he obtained, upon Condition of delivering up his Sons in Hoſtage; who being in the Grand Seignior's hands, he cauſed them to be circumciſed, (giving to <hi>George,</hi> in whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary appeared at his Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the name of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> i. e. Lord <hi>Alexander;</hi>) he was about nine years old at this time, and <hi>Amurath</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a liking to him, appointed him good Maſters and Inſtructers, under whom he quickly learned the <hi>Turkiſh, Arabian, Greek, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Languages; and as his Strength encreaſed, he acquired all thoſe Exerciſes as might fit him for the War; and ſometimes with his Sword and ſometimes with his Bow, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back and foot, he gave incredible teſtimonies of agility and readineſs of Body, and of an undertaking couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit: hereupon the Sultan made him a <hi>Sunziack</hi> and Collonel of five thouſand Horſe. His Brethren al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo proving very good Souldiers, he employed them in ſeveral parts of his Empire.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:46445:110"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> when he was eighteen years old, was ſent by <hi>Amurath</hi> into <hi>Natolia,</hi> where in his firſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe his Virtue and good Succeſs in War appeared, and he returned victorious: and afterwards he, with his Regiment, always made one in all Enterprizes; and the good Succeſs was, by the common Conſent of all the Souldiery, ſtill caſt upon him. And now Troubles ariſing in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he, at thoſe Years, was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen General of the whole Army; by which means, and the quick and ſpeedy defeat of his Enemies, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all the glory of his former Performances.</p>
               <p>About this time, there came a Gyant-like <hi>Scythian</hi> to the Court, demanding if there were any that durſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him in Arms, and prove himſelf in fight againſt him. <hi>Amurath</hi> the Sultan proclaimed and promiſed to the Conquerour a great Reward, to encourge his Men to undertake the Combate. But when every one dreaded the purchaſe of Honour upon ſuch deſperate Conditions, (for they were to fight in their Shirts in a narrow place, with their Swords only) <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to him, ſaid, <hi>Either ſhalt thou not, O</hi> Scythian, <hi>bear away this Prize and Glory, or elſe being made more glorious by my Death, thou ſhalt be enriched with theſe Spoils and Ornamenas.</hi> In the Duel <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ſlew the <hi>Scythian,</hi> without receiving the leaſt Wound from him; and preſenting his Head to <hi>Amurath,</hi> received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his Victory.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, two <hi>Perſians</hi> of a fair and goodly Stature, came and made the like Challenge to fight on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; and when all refuſed, he took up the Gantlet againſt them: and whereas (contrary to the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) after his firſt Courſe, they both aſſaulted him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he ſo acquitted himſelf that he ſlew them both, and preſented their Heads to <hi>Amurath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time died <hi>John Caſtriot,</hi> his Father, in <hi>Epyre:</hi> upon notice whereof, <hi>Amurath</hi> ſeized upon his Kingdom, put Garriſons into all the Cities and ſtrong Holds, and poyſoned all the Brethren of <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46445:111"/>Now, though <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> diſſembled his Reſentment of this Conduct, yet the <hi>Sultan</hi> growing jealous of him, put him upon all the deſperate Service; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his forwardneſs upon all Occaſions, Providence preſerved him to be a Scourge to the Enemies of his Name.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>Amurath</hi> made War upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for aſſiſting the Deſpot of <hi>Miſſa;</hi> and thereupon raiſing an Army of eighty thouſand Men, he ſent <hi>Carambey,</hi> the Baſſa of <hi>Romania</hi> with <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> and an Army of twenty thouſand Men, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Hungarians. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> with the great <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niades,</hi> that famous Captain, prepared an Army of five and thirty thouſand men to encounter him. The <hi>Baſſa</hi> encamped by the River of <hi>Moravia: Hanniades</hi> not enduring this Bravado, with ten thouſand Men, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King in his Camp, paſſed the River to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> who contemning his ſmall number, began the Fight. <hi>Caſtriot</hi> ſeeing an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to accompliſh what he had before reſolved on, in the beginning of the Battel began to retreat with his Troops, and afterwards fled, thereby putting the other <hi>Turks</hi> into a Conſternation, who made uſe of their Heels in like manner. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having before im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted his Deſign to his Friends, eſpecially to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Amaſe,</hi> as they fled through a Wood, he laid his hands upon the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Secretary, and cauſed him with Threatnings to write Letters in the name of <hi>Amurath,</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Croia,</hi> (the Regal City of <hi>Epirus</hi>) to deliver up his Command into the hands of <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> as deputed by him to have the Command thereof: and then killing the Secretary, he poſted by very long Journeys into the upper <hi>Dibria,</hi> where, ſending for ſome of the principal men of the Town, he diſcovered himſelf and his purpoſes to them, who unanimouſly aſſented to what he deſired, preſenting to him their Eſtates and Lives for the ſetling of him in his Kingdom; and ſo taking good order for all his Affairs, he haſted
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46445:111"/>towards <hi>Croia,</hi> ſending <hi>Amaſe</hi> before to carry News to the Governour, and to certifie him, that <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> with his Train was not far behind: he took with him his Friends, and a ſelect Number of <hi>Dibrians,</hi> and ſo coming into <hi>Croia,</hi> he delivered the Packet, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened and read was eaſily believed, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour prepared to depart.</p>
               <p>The Night after, his Men at Arms, which he had left ſecretly near the Town, were let in, with whom many of the Citizens joyned, who ſetting firſt upon the Watch, and then on the Garriſon, put moſt of them to the Sword; and ſo having made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Croia,</hi> he preſently ſent to <hi>Dibria</hi> to give his Friends notice of his Succeſs, and to ſtir up that Country and their Allies, to lay hold of the opportunity for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their Freedom. He alſo gave notice to all the Country about <hi>Croia,</hi> ſtirring them up to take Arms to free themſelves from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Yoak; who readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with much Joy, received him, and many good Officers flocked to him; ſo that having got together pretty conſiderable Forces, he routed and put to the Sword an Army of the <hi>Turks</hi> that were upon the march for the oppoſing theſe Progreſſes. And then he beſieged and took <hi>Petrella, Petra Alba,</hi> and <hi>Stelliſa,</hi> all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtrong Towns; after which, all the weaker Garriſons caſily yielded to him.</p>
               <p>Then leaving ſome Forces under his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Moſes,</hi> an excellent Souldier, he returned to <hi>Croia</hi> and disbanded his Army; but upon notice that the <hi>Turks</hi> were rendezvouzing, taking his Followers and a hundred Horſe, he ſtreight march'd to the place, upon which the <hi>Turks</hi> ſcattered and diſperſed themſelves: then with a thouſand Horſe he made an Inroad into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> ſpoiling all the Country, and returned load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the Prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> having notice of all theſe Occurrences, made Peace with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and bent all his Thoughts againſt <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:46445:112"/>
               <p>The Spring coming on, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> took the Field with ſix thouſand men, conquered <hi>Morea,</hi> a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Fruitful Countrey, and added it to his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and then, after ſome time Siege, had <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> ſurrendred to him, being a place of great importance.</p>
               <p>Theſe Succeſſes highly incenſed and alarmed <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> ſo that he cauſed an Army to be raiſed of forty thouſand Horſe, which he committed to the leading of <hi>Hali Baſſa,</hi> one of his moſt valiant and experienced Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Whereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> leavied an Army of eight thouſand horſe and ſeven thouſand foot, and though many more flocked to him, he diſmiſſed the reſt; with them he went into the lower <hi>Dibria,</hi> where he heard daily of the approach of his Enemies. Hereupon he detached <hi>Gree Muſach</hi> and <hi>Amaſe</hi> with three thouſand horſe, for to lie in Ambuſcado, which he had no ſooner done, than the <hi>Turks</hi> began to approach, pitching their Camp near <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> yet knew not that he was ſo night them. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having appointed good Watch, bade the reſt of his men to betake themſelves to their reſt. The <hi>Turks</hi> having diſcovered him, grew very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, and coming near the <hi>Christians</hi> Camp, began to revile them, and challenge them to the Battel; <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> made his men to be quiet till the riſing of the Moon, then he cauſed them to refreſh themſelves with Food, and ſo ſome of them to iſſue forth to ſkirmiſh with the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the mean time he ordered his Battel: <hi>Halli Baſſa</hi> contemning the ſmall number of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, gave the firſt charge with a ſmall Troop of horſe, who after they had charged, retired, hoping that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> with eager purſuit, would diſorder their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> finding their Policy, kept his men in good order, ſo both Armies coming on, the Wings began the Battel afreſh; <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> bringing on the main Battel in the face of the Baſſa, valiantly charged him. No ſooner were the Battels thoroughly joyned, but the Ambuſcado broke out, and charged the Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Turks,</hi> making ſuch a ſlaughter, that ſome
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46445:112"/>of them began to fly. Thus was the Baſſa's great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my diſtreſſed by a few. But he having placed his beſt Souldiers neareſt to himſelf, with them renewed the Fight, ſo that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s fortune was at a ſtand, till <hi>Heranocontes</hi> coming on with ſome freſh Troops from the Rear, brake thorough the Baſhaw's Army, with incredible Slaughter of his Men: ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing their Fellows lying by heaps, wallowing in their own Blood, betook themſelves to flight, whom the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> fiercely purſuing, ſlew two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them, took two thouſand priſoners, and four and twenty Enſigns of the <hi>Turks:</hi> and ſo horſing all his foot Souldiers, with the horſes of the ſlain <hi>Turks,</hi> he made a Road into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> laying all waſte before him, and returned with a Rich Booty, beſides all the Spoiles gotten in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, and with it went back to <hi>Croia,</hi> where he was received with great Triumph. <hi>Halli Baſſa</hi> with the remainder of his men returned to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he had much adoe to make his Peace with the Sultan, who was almoſt ready to die for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair thorough his great loſſes before in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and in <hi>Epirus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while the Pope's Legat perſwaded the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to break the League lately made with <hi>Amurath,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Faith was not to be kept with Inſidels and Miſcreants,</hi> and he abſolved the King and his Nobles from their Oath to the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon great preparations were made, a great Army rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whereof <hi>Hunniades</hi> was made the Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> alſo wrote to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who after a Council held with his Princes, aſſented to it, and raiſing a potent Army, and ſeeking to God by Prayer, for a proſperous Journey, he marched towards <hi>Hungary.</hi> But God intending to chaſtize the Perjury of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and to preſerve <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from having had a hand in ſo horrid a Sin, ſtirred up the Deſpot of <hi>Miſſa</hi> (a Perſon of no Religion) to deny him paſſage thorough his Country. Whereupon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46445:113"/>
                  <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> reſolved to force it, though it was like to prove a difficult work: and indeed before he could do it, the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> had fought a dreadful Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, wherein many were ſlain, and amongſt others, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> with his perjured Nobles, and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army was wholly overthrown. The news whereof coming to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> he was ſo grieved and inraged alſo at the Deſpot, that he ſpoiled his Country with fire and ſword, and ſo returned home again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> being informed of the Extraordinary ſpoil and havock that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had made in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> reſolved he ſhould next feel the effects of his reſentment, and firſt thought to have undermined him by the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a profered Peace and Amity, which being ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> the Sultan was extreamly incenſed, and ſent for <hi>Fereſſay Baſſa,</hi> a Captain of a fierce and ready Spirit, and loading him with promiſes if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Victor, he gave him nine thouſand Horſe, all choſen men, commanding him in all haſte to go ſurpriſe the Enemy in <hi>Epirus,</hi> who having diſmiſſed his Army, kept the Field only with a few Horſe. The <hi>Turks</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing themſelves a certain Victory, marched on merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till they came to a narrow Valley called <hi>Mocrea,</hi> which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his men having ſeized on, upon notice of the Enemies deſigns, where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> put the Baſſa to flight, cut moſt of his men to pieces, and the reſt he took Priſoners.</p>
               <p>This news incenſed <hi>Amurath</hi> to a high degree, and thereupon ſent one <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> a bold and politick Captain; with a new ſupply of ſix thouſand Souldiers to take <hi>Fereſaye</hi>'s charge, which joyned with other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made up an Army of above twenty thouſand men, but he was in like manner incountred by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> his Forces routed, five thouſand of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſlain, three hundred taken, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> loſt but twenty Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and fifty Footmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muſtapha</hi> obtained afterwards another mighty Army of <hi>Amurath,</hi> with which he marched againſt <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:46445:113"/>who lying at the Siege of <hi>Duyna</hi> againſt the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> upon notice of the Enemies approach he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached five hundred Horſe, and a thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Footmen, wherewith he haſted to the relief of his Gariſons, leaving the reſt with <hi>Amaſe</hi> to continue the Siege: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> at his return having drawn ſome Forces out of his Gariſons, had got together a Body of Men conſiſting of four thouſand Horſe, and two thouſand Foot, with which he prepared himſelf for Battel. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> did the like; but before the Battel began, there came from the <hi>Turks</hi> a man at Arms in rich and gallant furniture, challenging any one of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to fight hand to hand with him. <hi>Paul Meneſſi</hi> thereupon ſtepped to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> deſiring leave that he might accept the challenge, and chaſtize the proud <hi>Turk,</hi> which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> aſſenting to, and praying for his Succeſs, he preſently mounted on Horſeback, rode forth to the <hi>Turk,</hi> bidding him to prepare himſelf to the Battel; both Generals agreed upon the Laws for Combat, and ſo the Champions taking their courſe, ran each at other with their Spears, and <hi>Meneſſi</hi> ran the <hi>Turk</hi> thorough the head, and ſo ſlew him, and there alighting, he ſtruck off his head, took his Armour, and returned to the Camp laden with his Spoyls.</p>
               <p>This good Omen did ſo incourage <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s men, that they charged the <hi>Turks</hi> with ſuch fury that they forced them to retire. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſeeing that, put Spurs to his Horſe, reſolving to win the Field or die; moſt of his chief Captains did the like, which a little renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Battel; but preſently <hi>Mustapha</hi> and twelve of his chiefeſt men were taken Priſoners, the reſt ſlain and ſcattered. There were in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp killed ten thouſand men, and fifteen Enſigns taken. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt but three hundred, and they found a rich Prey.</p>
               <p>Then did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> make an Inroad into <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſpoiled and took a great Booty; after which, he left two thouſand Horſe and one thouſand Foot for the guard of his Frontiers, and ſo returned to the Siege of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46445:114"/>
                  <hi>Duyna.</hi> But ſhortly after he made Peace with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, Amurath</hi> too ſent him rich Preſents, with five and twenty thouſand Duckats for the Redemption of his Captains: nevertheleſs, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having divided the Money amongſt his Souldiers, made another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and dividing his Army into three parts, he laid all waſte, and brought away a rich Prey, that he might leave nothing for the relief of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when they returned again.</p>
               <p>This put <hi>Amurath</hi> into ſuch a Rage, that he reſolved to go in Perſon with ſuch an Army as might fill every Corner of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and make an eaſie Conqueſt of it. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having notice of the great Preparations that the Sultan was making for an Invaſion, did likewiſe put all things in the beſt poſture of Deſence that was poſſible. <hi>Amurath</hi> in the mean while came with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a hundred and fifty thouſand Horſe and Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Epirus,</hi> but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having laid an Ambuſcade for a detachment of forty thouſand that were going to beſiege <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> his Men killed two thouſand of the <hi>Turks,</hi> took a thouſand Horſe, and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> loſt but two and twenty Men.</p>
               <p>During the Siege of the forementioned Town, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> with his handful, was perpetually beating up and alarming the <hi>Turk</hi>'s Quarters, and ſet ſo furiouſly and ſo unluckily upon them one Night, that he ſlew two thouſand of them: the Souldiers too within the Town made a brave Defence, and beat off ſeveral gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attacks with great Slaughter of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having gathered nine thouſand Souldiers, reſolved to aſſault the Camp; but <hi>Feri Baſſa</hi> deſpiſing his ſmall number, ſent ſeveral thouſand Horſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs him in behind; but all to his own Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for fighting with <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hand to hand, he was ſlain by this latter, and in that days work were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> killed by the Wounded. But <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> ſeeing he could not prevail by force, uſed means to corrupt ſome of the Garriſon; which having effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46445:114"/>the Town was delivered to him; the Traytors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their promiſed Reward, but within a few days after were ſecretly, at his Command, made away, as a juſt Recompence for their trayterous Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> having loſt thirty thouſand of his Souldiers in this Expedition, returned home, being followed at the heels by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who ſlew many more of his Men in narrow Paſſages, which more and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked <hi>Amurath</hi> to the making extraordinary Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the enſuing Campaign; by which time, having gotten together an Army of a hundred and ſixty thouſand men, with which he again invaded <hi>Epirus,</hi> and laid Siege to <hi>Croia,</hi> the Capital City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And after many Artifices and Endeavours to ſuborn the Governour and the other Officers, finding that could not be effected, after having battered it with great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-pieces, the Sultan made a general Aſſault. But juſt as the <hi>Turks</hi> began it, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with five thouſand men brake into one of their Quarters, and at the firſt Encounter ſlew ſix hundred of them, yet engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far in the Fight, that he was in much danger to be ſlain or taken Priſoner, but at length reſolutely breaking through them, he eſcaped, and came to his Camp, to their great Joy and Comfort.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Amurath</hi> renewed the Aſſault, wherein he loſt eight thouſand Men without any conſiderable damage to the Garriſon. And <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in the night broke in again upon their Quarters, making a much greater ſlaughter of the Enemy than the Garriſon had done.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſtill made ſeveral Attacks in vain, wherein they loſt many thouſands more of their Men, <hi>Amurath</hi> laid it to heart that ſo ſmall a Town ſhould eclipſe all his former Glory, that he died in the Army, of Grief, Rage, and Deſpair; but charging his Son and principal Officers not to leave his Death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged, and ſo gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:46445:115"/>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Amurath, Mahomet</hi> his Son pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rais'd the Siege, and offered Peace to <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> if he would pay him a certain Tribute; but <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> ſcorning the Motion, made an Inroad into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, which he grievouſly waſted, and returned home laden with ſpoil. To revenge this, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent an Army into <hi>Epirus,</hi> under one of his principal Baſſa's; but being re-encountred by <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg,</hi> he ſlew ſeven thouſand of them, took the Baſhaw and principal Officers, Priſoners, whom <hi>Mahomet</hi> ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed with thirteen thouſand Duckats, and other rich Preſents which he ſent to <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi>

               <p>Hereupon one <hi>Debreas,</hi> one of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s beſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, undertook, with ſuch an Army, to conquer <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and bring <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Head to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he marched with ſuch and as many Men as he deſired, and a Battel was ſo valiantly fought, that <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>'s Fortune ſeem'd to be at a ſtand; yet <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> having at laſt encountred <hi>Debreas,</hi> fought with him hand to hand, and ſlew him, with whoſe Death the whole Enemies Army was diſcouraged and fled; and of the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſlain four thouſand one hundred and twenty, but of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> very few.</p>
               <p>The Grand Seignior finding by theſe Defeats, that it lay not in his Power to prevail by Force, had Recourſe to Artifice, and ſought to corrupt, by mighty Offers and Promiſes, the principal Officers of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and at length found the means to ſeduce <hi>Moſes Galome,</hi> a great Commander, who had treacherouſly aſſured <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> of Succeſs if he would beſiege <hi>Belgrade,</hi> which having done upon his Advice, he brought the Town to great diſtreſs before it could be relieved; but <hi>Moſes</hi> having given the <hi>Turks</hi> warning of his Deſigns, they came upon him unawares, ſlew many of his Men, and rais'd the Siege: nevertheleſs, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> fought their Army, ſlew three thouſand of the Miſereants, and with his own hand two brave Champions, who had before ſworn to <hi>Mahomet</hi> to kill him if they met with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46445:115"/>him. The poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captives taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> were ſome ſold for Slaves, others impailed alive upon ſharp Stakes, others hanged on iron Hooks, and others cruelly tortured to death at the Victor's Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> threw off the Maſk, and went to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> of whom having obtain'd, upon aſſurance of Conqueſt, a great Army, with all things neceſſary, went againſt <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> When the two Armies were ready to joyn, a Meſſenger came from the <hi>Turks,</hi> to ſee if any durſt prove his Valour againſt a Champion of the <hi>Turks,</hi> hand to hand; the Challenger was accepted, and the <hi>Turk</hi> appearing, <hi>Zacharie Groppa</hi> having obtained leave of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> went out againſt him, and after a ſhort Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, they ran with their Lances each againſt other with ſuch Fury, that both Horſes and Men were overturned; then nimbly recovering themſelves, they drew their Semiters, and encountred each other with ſuch ſturdy Strokes, that at laſt both their Swords fell out of their Hands; then grapling together, they wreſtled ſo long till <hi>Groppa</hi> overthrew his Adverſary, and with his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thruſt him into his Throat, and then taking a Sword, he cut off his Head, and returned to <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> with great Honour. Then the Signal of the Battel being given, it was obſtinately fought on both ſides, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> ran great danger of his life,; for a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Turk,</hi> with his Horſe-man's Staff, bare him quite backward upon his Horſe, ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhouted for Joy, hoping that he had been ſlain: but <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> chafed with ſuch an unwonted Diſgrace, ſuriouſly aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Turk</hi> and ſlew him, and purſued his Victory with that Eagerneſs, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were defeated, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thouſand of them ſlain, and not above one hundred of the <hi>Christians,</hi> and eighty wounded.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Moſes</hi> being tormented in Conſcience, ſtole from the <hi>Turks,</hi> returned to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> obtain'd Pardon and his former Truſt and Offices.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Amaſe, Scanderbeg</hi>'s Nephew, was inveigled by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſo that he abandoned his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46445:116"/>Uncle, and went to the Grand Seignior. Hereupon in the Spring following, he and <hi>Iſaac</hi> Baſſa, were ſent the Spring following with a mighty Army, and <hi>Amaſe</hi> was proclaimed King of <hi>Epirus</hi> in <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s name. After ſeveral Skirmiſhes between the two Armies, wherein the <hi>Turks</hi> had always the worſt; at length <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his Army deſcended from the Mountain with ſuch horrible Shouts and noiſe of Inſtruments of War, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were in a kind of Conſternation, and thought the Enemy to be much more numerous than they were: nevertheleſs, <hi>Amaſe</hi> rallied, and made a brave Defence, but at length was forced to yield to his Uncle's Bravery and Conduct, ſo that the whole Turkiſh Army was routed, many of them were ſlain, and many taken Priſoners, together with twenty of the <hi>Turks</hi> faireſt Enſigns, of whom were ſlain about twenty thouſand, and of the <hi>Christians</hi> about ſixty; <hi>Amaſe</hi> being likewiſe taken and condemned to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Impriſonment. Then a Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> after the expiration of which, <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent <hi>Synanbeg</hi> with an Army of twenty thouſand into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> with which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> forthwith encounter'd and overthrew, ſo that few eſcaped by flight. Then ſent he <hi>Aſambeg</hi> with thirty thouſand, with whom <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> in plain Battel vanquiſhed at <hi>Ocrida,</hi> and took <hi>Aſambeg</hi> Priſoner, and uſed him honourably, and afterwards diſmiſſed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſſumbeg</hi> came after with eighteen thouſand, was ſet upon by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> had many ſlain, and himſelf hardly eſcaped by flight. Then <hi>Carafabeg,</hi> an old and expert Captain, deſired <hi>Mahomet</hi> to let him try his Fortune, who ſent him with an Army of almoſt forty thouſand. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> fearing him more than any of the former, and therefore raiſed more Forces; yet he was too cunning as well as too brave for the Baſhaw, for he ſlew many of his Men, and had routed all his Forces had not the Armies been ſeparated by a Storm. So that the old General was conſtrained to return back
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46445:116"/>to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with the remainder of his Army, and was well derided by his Maſter for having promiſed ſo much and performed ſo little.</p>
               <p>After this a Peace was again concluded, upon expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> entred with an Army into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> made much Spoyl, and returned with great Booty. Hereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſent a new Army to defend the Borders, but this was likewiſe routed by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> ten thouſand of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſlain, twelve of their principal Officers taken Priſoners, for whom he had forty thouſand Duckats in Ranſom.</p>
               <p>Then was another Baſſa called <hi>Bartabanus</hi> ſent with a new Army, who had ſeveral Skirmiſhes with <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi> but had ſtill the worſt. But at length, ſome of the principal Officers in the heat of the Fight ingaging too far, quite contrary to his orders, were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> refuſed to ſuffer them to be ranſomed, and knowing them to be <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s beſt Captains, he flayed them alive by degrees, ſo that they were fifteen days a dying.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, though the <hi>Turks</hi> had corrupted <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>'s Scouts, yet he was ſo well upon his Guard, that when they came upon him above two to one, he put them to the worſt, and ſlew them almoſt all. But as he was fighting in the midſt of his Enemies, his Horſe was ſlain under him, and in the fall ſorely bruiſed one of his Arms; the <hi>Turks</hi> preſſed on vehemently to have ſlain him; but God delivered him, his Souldiers reſcuing and re-mounting him, and he forthwith incountring one of the <hi>Turks</hi> great Commanders, ſlew him hand to hand, which ſo terrified the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they fled and ſuch ſlaughter was made of them, that few returned with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus,</hi> who adviſed the Sultan to invade <hi>Epyrus</hi> with two Armies at a time, which advice being liked off, one Baſſa <hi>Jacup</hi> invaded it on one ſide with ſixteen thouſand brave men, and <hi>Burtabanus</hi> on another with four and twenty thouſand good Souldiers. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having got together twelve thouſand choice Souldiers,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46445:117"/>challenged <hi>Bartabanus,</hi> who had fortified his Camp to the Combat, which he refuſing, the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſo derided and provoked by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s men, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at the affront, forced their General to hazard the Battel, which proved dangerous and doubtful; yet <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his men ſo preſſed upon them on all ſides, that at laſt they were broken in pieces, moſt of them ſlain, only <hi>Bartabanus</hi> with ſome few eſcaped. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had ſcarce divided the Spoyl, when a Poſt brought him News, that <hi>Jacup</hi> was burning all in another part of the Country, whereupon he preſently marched thitherward, and his men went as to an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Victory. <hi>Jacup</hi> hearing of his coming, retired into a corner of the Plain, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> coming near him, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one whole day, and then brought forth ſome of his Priſoners before his Enemies Camp, who before knew nothing of <hi>Bartabanus</hi>'s overthrow. Then the Battel beginning, it was fiercely fought on both ſides, the <hi>Turks</hi> were beaten and moſt of them ſlain: In all there were ſlain in the two Battels four and twenty thouſand men, and ſix thouſand Priſoners. <hi>Jacup</hi> eſcaped with a few: after which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> entered into the <hi>Turks</hi> Territories, made havock of all, and ſo returned with his Victorious Army to <hi>Croia,</hi> where he diſmiſſed them every man to his own home.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Mahomet</hi> imployed two Aſſaſſianates to murder him, but being diſcovered, they were upon their own confeſſion juſtly executed according to their Merit; Then <hi>Mahomet</hi> failing too that way, raiſed an Army of two hundred thouſand men, with which he likewiſe invaded <hi>Epirus,</hi> whereof <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having intelligence, he put his Town in the beſt poſture of defence that was poſſible, by which time <hi>Mahomet</hi> with thoſe vaſt Forces ſat down before <hi>Croia,</hi> but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> did ſo ply him with continual allarums, and was ſo perpetually beating up his Quarters, that he grew weary of the Expedition, and returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> leaving his Baſſa, ſtill to maintain the Siege of the Town. In his way home he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46445:117"/>corrupted the Governour of a Fort called <hi>Chidna,</hi> in which were eight thouſand of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Souldiers, promiſing them liberty and ſafety to depart: but when he had prevailed, and had them in his power, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cauſed them cruelly to be cut in pieces, ſparing neither Souldiers nor Inhabitants, Man, Woman nor Child. <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> diſdaining to have his Capital City beſieged by <hi>Bartabanus,</hi> with fourteen thouſand choice Souldiers he marched to indeavour its relief, but by the way, hearing that <hi>Janima</hi> was coming with a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the <hi>Turks,</hi> he detached a party of his men, and routed this new Army, and took <hi>Janima</hi> and his Sons Priſoners, whom the next day he ſhewed to <hi>Bartabanus,</hi> and then with plain force drave the <hi>Turks</hi> from a Mountain near the City. The <hi>Turks,</hi> diſcouraged with theſe and other ſuch like things, roſe in the ſilence of the Night, and retreated eight miles from the City. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> the next morning found in their Tents great ſtore of Corn and other Proviſion, which he conveyed into <hi>Croya</hi> in great Triumph.</p>
               <p>The Spring following, <hi>Mahomet</hi> with a mighty Army again entred <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and having beſieged ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, did at length again lay Siege to <hi>Croia,</hi> but with the ſame fortune as formerly, for many of his men being day by day out off by <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being in want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, he was forced to return to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> covered with ſhame and rage.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was now buſie in putting his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into good order, he fell ſick of a Feaver, and perceiving his end to draw nigh, he ſent for his Wiſe, his Son, and the confederate Princes, and diſcourſed to them of his troubleſome Life, forewarned them of the dangers were like to enſue, to perſevere in Unity, made the <hi>Venetians</hi> Protectors of his Son and Kingdom, and ſo after he had with moſt fervent Prayer commended his Soul into the hands of the Almighty God, he quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left this Life <hi>Jan.</hi> 17. <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1466. and of his age ſixty three, and of his Reign twenty four. He
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46445:118"/>was royally buried in the Cathedral in <hi>Lyſſa;</hi> yet nine years after, the <hi>Turks</hi> having taken the City, with great Devotion digged up his Bones, reckoning it ſome part of their heppineſs, if they might ſee or touch the ſame; ſuch as could get any part thereof ſet it on Silver or Gold, and hung it about their Necks, perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that it would make them Valiant and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>He was a man of rare Parts, and of an indefatigable Spirit: during all the time of his Wars, he never ſlept above two houres a Night; he ever Fought againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> with his Arm bare, and that with ſuch fierceneſs, that the Blood did oft'times burſt out of his Lips. He with his own hands ſlew at leaſt three thouſand of the <hi>Turks.</hi> What his ſtrength was, may appear by theſe Examples. There was in a part of <hi>Epyrus</hi> a mighty wild Bull, that had murdered many, and committed a thouſand outrages: him <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> incountred with on Horſe-back, and with one only blow of his Semiter he cut his Neck clean from his Shoulders.</p>
               <p>Alſo a Monſtrous Boar in <hi>Apulia</hi> that had wounded many of King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Courtiers, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being hunting with the King, incountred with this Beaſt, and ſoon ſevered his head from his Body.</p>
               <p n="158">CLVIII. Strange is the Story of <hi>Macamat,</hi> Sultan of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> he kept an Army of 20000 Horſe-men. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning reſort to his Palace fifty men ſitting on Elephants, their office is, with all Reverence to ſalute the Sultan, the Elephants alſo kneeling down. Aſſoon as he waketh, is heard a great Noiſe of Trumpets, Waits, and Drums, with other muſical Inſtruments, in rejoycing that the Sultan liveth, and the like at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. His Muſtanchoes are ſo long, that he beareth them up with a Filler, as Women do the hair of their heads. his Beard was white and long, to the very Navel. He was ſo accuſtomed to Poyſon from his Infancy, that he daily eat ſome to keep it in uſe; and though he feel no hurt himſelf thereof by reaſon of Cuſtom, yet doth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46445:118"/>he ſo venome himſelf, that he is Poyſon to others; for when he is diſpoſed to put any of his Noble-men to Death, he cauſeth him to be brought to his Preſence and ſtand naked before him, then he cateth certain Fruits like Nutmegs, and alſo the leaves of ſome Herbs, adding thereto the Powder of beaten Oyſter Shells, chewing them a while in his Mouth, he ſpitteth it upon him he deſigns to kill, who being ſparkled therewith, dieth bp the force of it within the ſpace of half an hour. He entertains about four thouſand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, for whenſoever he hath lain with any of them at Night ſhe that lies with him is dead on the Morning: or when he changeth his Shirt or other Apparel, no man dares wear it. The Reaſon of his being ſo veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, is, becauſe his Father brought him up ſo of a Child with Poyſon little by little, with Preſervatives ſo accuſtoming him thereto.</p>
               <p n="159">CLIX. Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> tells in his Voyage at the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Court; it happened to a great Friend of mine (a chief man having under his Charge the King's Wardrobe, all ſorts of Mercery, and his <hi>China</hi> diſhes) that a fair <hi>China</hi> diſh (which coſt forty five Rials of Eight) was broken by a Miſchance, (when the King was in his Progreſs) being packed amongſt other things, on a Camel, which fell and broke all the whole Parcel. This Noble-man knowing how dearly the King loved this Diſh above the reſt, preſently ſent a Servant to <hi>China Machina</hi> to ſeek another, hoping that he would return with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like this, before it would be miſſed: but his evil Luck was contrary; for the King two years after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred this Diſh, and his Man was not yet come. Now when the King heard the Diſh was broken, he was in a great Rage, commanding him to be brought before him, and to be beaten by two Men, with two Whips made of Cords, and after that he had received a hundred and twenty Laſhes, he commanded his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to beat him with their ſmall Cudgels till a great many of them were broken; at laſt twenty men were
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46445:119"/>beating of him, till the poor man was thought to be dead, and then he was haled out by the Heels, and commanded to Priſon. The next day the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether he was living? Anſwer was made, he was. Whereupon, he commanded he ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to perpetual Priſon. The King's Son being his Friend, freed him of that, and obtain'd of his Father that he might be ſent home and there cured: ſo after two Months he was reaſonable well recovered, and came before the King, who preſently commanded him to depart the Court, and never come again before him until he had found ſuch a little Diſh, and that he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd for <hi>China Machina</hi> to ſeek it; the King allowing him 5000 Rupies for his Charges; and beſides, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning one fourth part of his Living that he had before to maintain him in his Travel. He being departed, and fourteen Months on his Travel, was not yet come home; but News came of him, that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> had the like Diſh, and for pitties ſake hath ſent it him, who at my Departure was on his way homeward.</p>

In <hi>Japan</hi> three were executed, <hi>viz.</hi> two Men and one Woman; the cauſe this: the Woman, none of the honeſteſt (her Husband travelled from home) had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe two their ſeveral Hours to repair unto her. The latter man not knowing of the former, and thinking the time too long, coming in before the hour appointed, found the firſt man with her already, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged thereat, he whipt out his Cattan, and wounded them both very ſorely, having very nigh hewn the Chine of the man's back in two, but as well as he might he cleared himſelf of the Woman, and recovering his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, wounded the other; the Street taking notice of this Fray, forth with ſeized upon them and led them aſide, and aquainted King <hi>Foyne</hi> therewith, who preſently gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſhould cut off their heads: which done, every man that liſted came to try the ſharpneſs of their Cattans upon the corps, ſo that before they left off, they had hewed them all three into pieces as ſmall as a mans hand,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46445:119"/>And yet notwithſtanding did not then give over, but placing the Pieces upon one another, would try how many of them they could ſtrike through at a blow: and the Pieces are left to the Fowls to devour.</p>

At the City of <hi>Feſs,</hi> their manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt a Malefactor is thus; having given him a 100 or 200 ſtripes before the Governour, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner putteth an Iron Chain about his neck, and ſo leadeth him ſtark-naked (his Privities only excepted) through all parts of the City: after the Executioner follows a Serjeant, declaring to all the People what Fact the Guilty Perſon hath committed, till at length, having put on his Apparel again, they carry him back to Priſon, ſomtimes it falls out that many Offenders chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together are led through the City and the Governour for each Malefactor thus puniſhed, receiveth one Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, and alſo at their firſt entrance into the Goal, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of each one a certain Duty, which is paid to him by divers Merchants and Artificers, appointed of purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="162">CLXII. At <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon Malefactors they inflict moſt horrible puniſhments, eſpecially upon them that have committed any heinous Crime in the Court. Thieves they condemn to the Halter. A Murther committed treacherouſly they puniſh in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following: The Executioner's aſſiſtants take the Malefactor one by the head, another by the feet, and then the chief Executioner with a two-handed Sword cutteth his Body in twain, the one part whereof adjoyning to the Head, is put into a Fire full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlacked Lime: and it is a moſt ſtrange and dreadful thing to conſider, how the ſame diſmembred half Body will remain alive in the fire for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour, ſpeaking and making anſwers to the ſtanders by. But Rebels or Seditious Perſons they flea alive, ſtuffing their Skins with Bran till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble man's ſhape, which being done, they carry the ſaid ſtuft Skins upon Camels backs through every ſtreet
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46445:120"/>of the City, and therein publiſh the Crime of the Party executed: but if the Tormentor once toucheth his Navel with the Knife, he preſently yieldeth up the Ghoſt: which he may not do until he be commanded by the Magiſtrate ſtanding by. If any be impriſoned for Debt, not having wherewithall to ſatisfie the ſame, the Governour of the Priſon payeth their Creditors, and ſendeth them poor wretches, bound in Chains, accompanied with certain Keepers, daily to beg Alms from ſtreet to ſtreet, all which Alms redound to the Governour, and he alloweth the ſaid Priſoners very bare maintenance to live upon.</p>

In <hi>Zant</hi> the Inhabitants of the Iſland are generally <hi>Grecians;</hi> in Habit they imitate the <hi>Italians,</hi> but tranſcend them in Revenges; they will threaten to kill a Merchant that will not buy their commodities, and make more Conſcience to break a Faſt than to commit a Murther. One of them (as our Author <hi>George Sandys</hi> ſaies) at our being there, purſued a poor Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor (an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man) for offering to convey a little bag of Currants aboard unaccuſtomed, and killed him, running up a pair of Stairs for ſuccour: but cowardize is joyned with their cruelty, who dare do nothing but ſuddenly, upon advantages; and are ever privately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, incouraged to villanies by the remiſneſs of their Laws: for none will lay hands upon an Offender until fourteen days after that he be called to the Scale, (a place of Publick Juſtice) who in the mean time hath leiſure to make his own peace, or elſe to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if then he appear not, they puniſh him; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a reward, according to the greatneſs of his offence, to him that ſhall either kill or take him alive: the Labourers do go into the Field with Swords and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, as if in an Enemies Country, bringing home their Wikes and Oyls in Hogs-skins, the In-ſides turned out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. It is a cuſtom among them to invite certain men unto Marriages, whom they call Compeers, every one of theſe do beſtow a Ring, which the Prieſts do

Of theſe they are never Jealous. The Bridegroom entring the Church, ſtrikes his Dagger in the door: held available againſt Inchantments, for here is a common practice to bewitch them: made therefore impotent with their Wives, until the Charm be burnt, or otherwiſe conſumed: inſomuch, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as they ſay) the Mothers of the betrothed, by way of prevention do bewitch themſelves and again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe themſelves as ſoon as the Marriage is conſummated.</p>

Beneath a Caſtle was a long Plain prepared for that purpoſe, in the midſt whereof was three heaps of Sand, fifty paces diſtant, and in each a Spear erected with a Mark to ſhoot at, and the like over againſt them, with ſpace between for ſix horſes to run a breaſt: here did the young <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> gallantly adorn'd, upon their Horſes running a full Career, yield ſtrange experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Skill, not one miſſing the Mark, firſt with caſting Darts, and after with their Arrows, as they ran; and laſtly trying their Staves; others after this, in the like race of their running horſes, ſhot with like Dexterity divers Arrows backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; others in the midſt of their race alighted three times, and (their Horſes ſtill running) mounted again, and hit the mark nevertheleſs: others did hit the ſame ſtanding on their Horſes thus ſwiftly running; others three times unbent their Bows and thrice bent them, again whilſt their Horſes ran, and miſſed not the Mark. Neither did others, which amidſt their Race, lighted down on either ſide, and again mounted themſelves; no nor they which in their ſwifteſt courſe leaped and turned themſelves backward on their Horſes, and then (their Horſes ſtill running) turned themſelves forward: there were them, which whilſt the Horſes ran, ungirt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46445:121"/>their Saddles thrice, and each time ſhooting, and then again girding their Saddles, and never miſſing the Mark, ſome ſitting in their Saddles leaped backwards out of them, and turning over their heads, ſettled themſelves again in their Saddles, and ſhot as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer three times; others laid themſelves backwards on their running Horſes, and taking their Tails, put them into their Mouths, and yet forgot not their Aim in ſhooting: ſome after every ſhot, drew out their Swords and flouriſhed them about their heads, and again ſheathed them: others ſitting between three Swords, on their right ſide, and as many on their left, thinly clothed, that without very great care, every motion would make way for death, yet before and behind them touched the Mark: one ſtood upon two Horſes running very ſwiftly, his feet looſe, and ſhot alſo at once three Arrows before, and again three behind him: another ſitting on a horſe neither bridled nor ſaddled, as he came at every Mark aroſe and ſtood on his Feet, and both hands hitting the Mark, ſate down again three times: a third ſitting on the bare Horſe, when he came to the Mark lay upon his back and lifted up his Legs and yet miſſed not his ſhoot; one of them was killed with a fall, and two ſore wounded in theſe their feats of Activity: they had an old grave man which was their teacher. If I have long detained thee in this ſpectacle, remember that the Race of <hi>Mamalukes</hi> ſhould not be forgotten, the rather, becauſe their name is now razed out of the World, and this may ſeem an Epitaph to their Sepulchre, after whom none are left perhaps able to do the like.</p>
               <p n="165">CLXV. But now I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeak of Death and the gallantry wherewith ſome Perſons have received it. And begin with the ſtory of <hi>Sophonisba,</hi> who was the Queen of <hi>Syphax</hi> the <hi>Numidian.</hi> He being made Priſoner to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhe came, yielded her ſelf to <hi>Maſſaniſſa,</hi> and vehemently beſought him, that he might not be delivered into the hands of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:46445:121"/>Her youth and excellent beauty ſo commended her ſuit, that he forthwith granted it, and to make good his promiſe, married her himſelf that very day, having been contracted with her before her Marriage with <hi>Syphax.</hi> But <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General gave him to underſtand that the <hi>Romans</hi> had title to her head, and that ſhe was a miſchievous Enemy of theirs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſed him not to commit a great offence upon little reaſon. <hi>Maſſaniſſa</hi> bluſhed and wept; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly having promiſed to be governed by <hi>Scipio,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to his Tent; where, after he had ſpent ſome time in Agony, he called to him a Servant, and tempring a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Sophomiba,</hi> ſent it her with this meſſage; that gladly he would have her to live with him as his Wife, but ſince they who had power to hinder him would not yield thereto, he ſent her a Cup that ſhould preſerve her from falling alive into the hands of the <hi>Romans;</hi> willing her to remember her Birth and Eſtate, and accordingly to take order for her ſelf. At the receipt of this Meſſage and Preſent ſhe only ſaid, that if her Husband had no better preſent for his new Wife, ſhe muſt accept this: adding, that ſhe might have died more honourably, if ſhe had not wedded ſo lately before her Funerals; and herewithal ſhe boldly drank off the Poyſon.</p>
               <p n="166">CLXVI. Dr. <hi>Fecknam</hi> was ſent to the Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> that ſhe muſt prepare her ſelf to die the next day; which meſſage was ſo little diſpleaſing to her, that ſhe ſeemed rather to rejoyce at it. The Doctor being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with her to leave her new Religion, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the old, ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had now no time to think on any thing, but of preparing her ſelf to God by Prayer: <hi>Fecknam</hi> thinking that ſhe had ſpoken this, to the end ſhe might have ſome longer time of life, obtained of the Queen three days longer, and then came and told ſo much to the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> whereat ſhe ſmiling ſaid, <hi>You are much deceived if you think I had any deſire of longer life: for I aſſure you, ſince the time you went
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46445:122"/>from me, my life hath been ſo odious to me, that I long for nothing ſo much as Death; and ſince it is the Queens plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I am moſt willing to undergo it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="167">CLXVII. Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, when ſhe was led to be beheaded in the Tower, ſhe called one of the King's Privy-Chamber to her, and ſaid unto him; commend me to the King, and tell him, he is conſtant in his courſe of advancing me; for from a private Gentlewoman he made me Marchioneſs, and from a Marchiones to a Queen; and now that he hath left no higher degree of worldly honour for me, he hath made me a Martyr.</p>
               <p n="168">CLXVIII. <hi>Calanus</hi> the <hi>Indian,</hi> of great fame and name for Philoſophy, and held in great reverence by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, when he had lived ſeventy three years in perfect health, and was now ſeized upon by a Diſeaſe, accounting that he had arrived at that term of Felicity, which both nature and fortune had allotted him, determined to depart out of life: and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe deſired of <hi>Alexander</hi> a Funeral Pile to be erected, and that as ſoon as he had aſcended to the top of it, he would appoint his Guard to put fire to it. The King not able to divert him from his purpoſe, commanded the Pile to be erected, an innumerable multitude of People flocked together to behold ſuch an unuſual a ſpectacle. <hi>Calanus,</hi> as he had ſaid, with a marvellous alacrity aſcended the top of the pile, and there laid him down, wherein he was conſumed to Aſhes.</p>
               <p n="169">CLXIX. But now it is time to bring them to their Graves, and give an account of the Cuſtoms of ſeveral Nations in the Burial of their dead, and begin with the Inhabitants dwelling near the River <hi>Nile,</hi> who not ſatisfied with Natures Treaſures, as Gold, Precious Stones, Fleſh in variety and the like; the Deſtruction of Men and Women neighbouring them better contents them, whoſe dead Carkaſſes they devour with a Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures appetite; whom if they miſs, they ſerve their Friends (ſo as they miſcall them) ſuch ſcurvy ſauce,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46445:122"/>butchering them, and thinking they excuſe all in a Complement; that they know no better way to expreſs Love, then in making (not two Soules) two Bodies one by ſuch an Union: yea ſome, as ſome report (worn by age or worm-eaten by the Pox) proſſer themſelves to the Shambles, and accordingly are disjoynted and ſet to ſaile upon the Stalls.</p>
               <p n="170">CLXX. The Funerals of the <hi>Bannyans</hi> are of the old ſtamp, ſacring the Corps to Aſhes in a holy fire, compounded of all ſorts of Wood and Aromatick Spices; the Wife alſo in epectation to injoy her Husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt incomparable pleaſures, invelops her dainty Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the mercileſs Flames, for which Affection ſhe obtains a living memory.</p>
               <p n="171">CLXXI. The Inhabitants of the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands waſht their dead, and kept them erected in a Cave, a Staff in one hand, and a Pail of Milk and Wine ſet near him to ſupport and comfort him in his Filgrimage to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizian</hi> Fields.</p>
               <p n="172">CLXXII. The <hi>Indians</hi> that dwell near the River <hi>Ganges</hi> have likewiſe the liberty to burn with their dead Husbands: ſo that death having cut in two their Union, the Relict conceits her ſelf a loathed Carcaſs, and reſolves to make her ſelf an Holocauſt, robes her Body with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent Lawn, her Arms, Legs and Thighs are alſo fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with Chains, expreſſing Love; but her Ears, Noſe and Fingers are adorned with Pearls and precious Stones: with one hand ſhe holds a Noſegay of Flowers, in the other a Ball; both which are emblems of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. She is attended with a great number, ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her for Love, others for Civility, but moſt for her incouragement and honour of the Ceremony: the Prieſts all the way ſhe goes deſcribe the Joys ſhe is to poſſeſs, and the aſſurance ſhe has to injoy her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſpeedily in the bleſſed ſhades below: ſhe returns a modeſt Smile, trips on chawing ſomething in her Mouth that intoxicares her Brains, and upon ſight of the Flames, ſeems tranſported with ſatisfaction. So ſoon
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46445:123"/>as ſhe ſees the Carkaſs of her Husband laid upon a Pile, and the fire burn, like a mad Lover ſhe whirles about the Pit, and having bid farewel to Parents, Children and Friends, willingly incorporates with the Fire; which quickly makes them one in Aſhes: Muſick of ſundry ſorts, and acclamations of the Spectators yell aloud at the ſame inſtant, both for the greater honour of the obſequie, and that the ſcreeches of the poor wretch may not be heard, whereby others may be diſcouraged. Now albeit ſome Women of this perſwaſion living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Prince being denied this liberty to burn with the Bodies of their Husbands Corps, have been known of late years to make themſelves away; yet others more Wiſe, and leſs valuing a place in the Catalogue of thoſe fiery Zealots, doe refuſe to burn: but in ſuch wiſe by way of Ignominy they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhave their heads and to ſequeſter, themſelves from company; which is a puniſhment. Howbeit this cuſtom of burning is much more ancient with men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Brachmans</hi> than with the other Sex: for with the latter it came not in practice until ſeveral of their Husbands were made away by Poyſon, which their laſcivious Wives would frequently miniſter upon giving them diſtaſte, or other ſlight provocations, for prevention whereof this Law was deviſed, and injoin'd the Relict: and though in its inſtitution it ſeem'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, it was to deterr them from that wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which long cuſtome had made familiar and reputable; whereof amongſt many other inſtances we find that of <hi>Mandanis</hi> the <hi>Gymnoſophiſt,</hi> who, as <hi>Strabo</hi> reports, was courted by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, to accept of a rich Preſent he made the Philoſopher; but contemning it and his glory, it (at leaſt ſeeming) ſo incenſed the King, that the <hi>Brachman</hi> for his arrogancy was condemned to death: and being told he might be pardoned, ſo he would but deſire it, with no leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſity anſwered, he would indeed petition <hi>Alexander</hi> not for life, but liberty to burn himſelf; giving this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46445:123"/>that death was in no wiſe terrible, where it is only an inlet unto immortality in exchange of his old periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fleſh, expecting a more durable and excellent condition.</p>
               <p n="173">CLXXIII. The Funerals of the <hi>Chinezes</hi> are after this ſort; When any dies, they firſt waſh, then perfume and laſtly apparel the Corps, and put his beſt Cloaths on, then cover his head; and having ſet him a Chair, his Wife entring the Room, firſt gives him a reſpect and then kiſſes him; After that, ſhe takes her farewel, with as much ſorrow as can be imagined: ſhe is no ſooner gone, but his Children enter in order according to their Seniorities; they firſt kneel, and then kiſs the dead mans's hand, yea ſtrive to outvie each other in their ejaculations, expreſſing their Love by ſorrowfull countenances and geſtures, as beating their Breaſts, and pouring out tears in abundance: being withdrawn, next his kindred act their parts, and laſtly his Friends, and other more remote acquaintance: the third day they lay him in a Coffin of precious Wood, which they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a Silk Cloth, and over it place his Picture; for fifteen days in that ſort the Corps reſts, and each day a Table is ſpread with meat, which nightly the Prieſts have the liberty to eat, for 'tis they who burn the Incenſe and offer Sacrifice. When they carry it to the Grave, Women are hired to howl, the better to move others to compaſſion: ſometimes upon his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin they place the Image of a dead man, whom they expect ſhould ſhew him the ſureſt and readieſt way to <hi>Elizyum:</hi> that done, the Women and Children for ſome daies ſeclude themſelves, and when abroad, go dolou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly habited, for they put courſe Sack-cloath near their Skin; have their Cloaths made long and plain and for three years are not ſeen to laugh or joy in any thing; but to the utmoſt of their Power, exerciſe their Love by their continual lamentation, abſtinence from Feaſts, and Paſtimes, and in all their Letters ſubſcribe themſelvs ſuch one's diſobedient and unworthy Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46445:124"/>Child, or what may beſt ſet forth Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
               <p n="174">CLXXIV. The <hi>Gowers</hi> being ſuch as follow the old Religion of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> differ in their Funeral Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from the <hi>Perſees</hi> who live at preſent in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:</hi> for in reverence to the Fire, theſe not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to burn the dead, fearing to offer it an unclean thing; but even hold it a Crime to ſpit into the Fire, which yet they repute Sacred. But whereas the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi> powder the dead with Salt and Spices to preſerve them from putrefaction, the <hi>Perſe</hi> in <hi>India</hi> expoſe the dead to the Sun's rage, till he have eaten them. And theſe <hi>Gowers</hi> oft times put them in the hollow of a Tree, ſtanding upright, ſupported by the Bole, till obſervation releaſe them: For if the Vultur pick out his right Eye firſt, then they conclude that he is in Paradice; if the left, then a <hi>Cacodaemon</hi> vexes him; and they feaſt or faſt by that obſervation, as Joy or Sorrow is occaſioned. Contrary to the <hi>Perſian Satrapae,</hi> who had their Graves ſo deep in the ſides of Rocks and Mountains, that they were uſually let down by cords or other like device many Fathoms, the Corps being firſt embalmed.</p>
               <p>The Burials of the <hi>Perſians</hi> revive ſome Ceremonies that of old were uſed amongſt the Jews and Gentiles: at his farewel to the World the next of Kin cloſe the Eyes, as did <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the 46 <hi>cap.</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemachus</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ille meos Occulos comprimat ille tuos.</hi>
                  </q> The nobler ſort of People had their Sepulchres in the ſides of Mountains or Hills about <hi>Perſepolis:</hi> howbeit, ſome uſed to embalm, the Brains being exhauſted by a ſilver Engine, the Belly (ſo ſoon as diſſected and the Bowels extracted) cleanſed with Wine, farced with Caſſica, Myrrhe, and other Spices, was then cloſed, and buried in extraordinary deep Pits or Vaults, or in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46445:124"/>places boarded in the ſides of Mountains. But the poorer ſort uſed only Bitumen or elſe the Juice of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, which reſiſts Putrefication. Howbeit, the moſt uſeful way of Burial is this; firſt, They waſh the Corps with clean Water, (as we find practiſed to <hi>Tabitha</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 9.) they carry it orderly and with Silence to the Grave, then lodge the Carcaſs, not in Machits or Churches, but Church-yards, and where none lay for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, ſuppoſing it a vile part to diſturb the dead, whom in the Grave they think ſenſible of Torment: they place his Head towards <hi>Medina,</hi> and for ſeven days the next of Kin watch, to keep, if poſſible, the evil Angel from his Grave, inceſſantly warbling out Elegiac Threnodies, as the laſt expreſſion of Love they can ſhew. Others thus; In the firſt place go thoſe of his Blood, next them, his Varlets naked to the Waſte, the reſt in Trouſes, who to expreſs their Zeal burn or ſcratch their Arms and Breaſts, and cut and print Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in their Fleſh, (a Mode borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> prohibited by <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.1. ſo that the Blood oft trickles down in many places; next them are ranked Youths, whoſe Shoulders bear ſome Texts out of the Alcoran, mixing with them Eulogies of the Defunct which they ingeminate: next theſe follow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons of beſt rank, each putting his hand to the Cord that draws the Hearſe, and on every ſide throng the Multitude, ſome bearing in their hands Lawrel or Cypreſs, others Garlands of Flowers, Fruits, and what beſt befits the Seaſon: ſome ſeminated Horſe-men play along, and oft times, to demonſtrate their Love, ſpare not to wound their Carcaſſes: in the laſt place go the <hi>Preficae</hi> or Women hired to weep and howl, who tear their falſe Hair, probably ſmell to Onions for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Tears, and uſe ſuch impoſtures as did the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Romans,</hi> who made it an Art to mourn, and by their counterfeit Tears and Shricks to provoke others to Paſſion and like Lamentation.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:46445:125"/>
               <p>But the Funerals of the <hi>Perſees</hi> is in this Manner; They neither burn nor bury their dead, but having firſt put the Body into a Winding-ſheet, all the way they paſs towards the Grave his Kindred beat their Breaſts, but with little noiſe, till they come within fifty or a hundred Paces of the Burial place; where the <hi>Herbood</hi> meets them, uſually attired in a yellow Scarf, and on his head wearing a thin Turband. The Neceſſilars or Bearers bear the Corps upon an iron Bier (for Wood is forbidden, in that it is dedicated to the Fire) to a little ſhed, where (ſo ſoon as ſome Miſtiques are acted) they hoiſe up to the top of a round Building, ſome of which are twelve foot high and eighty in circuit; the entrance is for the moſt part at the North-eaſt ſide, where through a ſmall Grate they convey the Carcaſs into a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; good men into one, bad into another. 'tis flat above, open to the Air, plaiſter'd with white Loam, hard and ſmooth like that of <hi>Paris:</hi> in the midſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a hole deſcending to the Bottom, made to let in the Putrefaction iſſuing from the melted Bodies, which are thereupon laid naked in two rows or Ranks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sun's rage and appetite of ravenous Birds, who ſpare not to devour the fleſh of theſe Carcaſſes, tearing aſunder and deforming them in an ugly ſort; ſo that the abominable ſtink of thoſe unburied Bodies (in ſome places three hundred) is ſo loathſom (that did not a deſire to ſee ſtrange Sights allure a Traveller) they would prove much worſe ſeen than ſpoken of.</p>
